Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved on port 80. The extracted data revealed that the requests were made to 'localhost:8080' using 'python-requests/2.22.0'. The URIs in the requests suggest interactions with a web application, possibly a phpMyAdmin interface, as indicated by the presence of 'index.php' and 'import.php'. This supports the hypothesis that the service or application involved is a local web service or application accessed via HTTP requests from a Python script using the requests library.
