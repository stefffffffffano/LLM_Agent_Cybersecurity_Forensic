"""
Executes the command tshark -r <pcap_file> -q -z conv,ip on the pcap file and returns the output.
It is used to be placed in the prompt, it's not a tool.
It shows a table of IP conversations, with columns like:

    -Source IP â†” Destination IP

    -Number of packets and bytes sent in each direction

    -Total packets and bytes

    -Duration of each conversation

This is useful for identifying the main endpoints communicating in a capture and the amount of data exchanged.
