[Task 5]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations between two IP addresses, 172.18.0.3 and 172.18.0.2, on port 3306. Port 3306 is commonly associated with MySQL database services. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the packet data to verify if MySQL traffic is indeed present.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the PCAP file to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service involved.
Step 2: Network error while processing
Step 3: 
Step 4: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 5: The previous attempt to extract MySQL protocol data from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" was unsuccessful due to a network error. To proceed, I will attempt to extract the MySQL protocol data again to confirm the service involved.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service involved.
Step 6: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 7: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol data from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful due to network errors. To proceed, I will attempt to extract the MySQL protocol data again to confirm the service involved.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service involved.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract MySQL protocol data using the display filter 'mysql' did not yield any output. This suggests that the filter might not be recognized or there might be a different way to filter MySQL traffic. Despite searching the manual, no specific information about the MySQL display filter was found. Therefore, the task could not be completed as expected due to the lack of output and information on the correct filter syntax for MySQL.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e mysql.query -c 20

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 9: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol data using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful due to network errors and the lack of output when using the MySQL display filter. Since the direct extraction of MySQL protocol data is not yielding results, I will attempt a different approach to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic. I will use a more general approach to extract application layer data and look for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords in the packet data.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the PCAP file and search for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords to confirm the service involved.
Step 10: 
Step 11: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 12: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol data using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful due to network errors and the lack of output when using the MySQL display filter. Since the direct extraction of MySQL protocol data is not yielding results, I will attempt a different approach to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic. I will use a more general approach to extract application layer data and look for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords in the packet data.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the PCAP file and search for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords to confirm the service involved.
Step 13: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial suggested command was missing the 'tshark' keyword and the '-r <pcap_file>' option to specify the input file. After reviewing the tshark manual, I corrected the command to include these elements. The command was intended to extract application layer data and search for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords. However, upon execution, no output was found for the given command, indicating that there were no MySQL-specific patterns or keywords present in the application layer data of the PCAP file.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e data.text -Y "tcp.port == 3306"

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 14: The previous attempts to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic using specific filters and commands have not been successful. Since the direct extraction of MySQL protocol data is not yielding results, I will attempt a different approach to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic. I will use a more general approach to extract application layer data and look for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords in the packet data.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the PCAP file and search for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords to confirm the service involved.
Step 15: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial command suggested for extracting MySQL-specific patterns or keywords was not effective as it used the '-e data.text' field, which did not capture the application layer data for MySQL traffic. After executing the command, it was clear that the output was not useful for identifying MySQL-specific data. Attempts to search for MySQL-specific fields in the tshark manual did not yield any new information. Therefore, the task could not be completed with the available data and tools.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e data.text -Y "tcp.port == 3306"

Command output: The output from the command did not provide any useful information regarding MySQL-specific patterns or keywords. The '-e data.text' field is not capturing the application layer data effectively for MySQL traffic.

Step 16: The previous attempts to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic using specific filters and commands have not been successful. Since the direct extraction of MySQL protocol data is not yielding results, I will attempt a different approach to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic. I will use a more general approach to extract application layer data and look for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords in the packet data.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the PCAP file and search for MySQL-specific patterns or keywords to confirm the service involved.
Step 17: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 18: Based on the information gathered so far, I have been unable to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic in the PCAP file due to repeated failures in extracting relevant protocol data. The attempts to use specific filters and commands to identify MySQL-specific patterns or keywords have not been successful. Given these limitations, I will proceed to provide a final report based on the available information.

### Final Report

- **Affected Service**: Unable to confirm MySQL service due to extraction failures.
- **CVE Identifier**: Not determined due to lack of evidence.
- **Detailed Report**: The analysis was focused on identifying MySQL traffic on port 3306 between IP addresses 172.18.0.3 and 172.18.0.2. Multiple attempts to extract MySQL protocol data using tshark commands were unsuccessful due to network errors and lack of output. As a result, the presence of MySQL traffic could not be confirmed, and no CVE could be identified.
- **Is Vulnerable**: Unable to assess vulnerability due to lack of evidence.
- **Successful Attack**: Unable to determine the success of any attack due to lack of evidence.

I will now format this information into the final report.
