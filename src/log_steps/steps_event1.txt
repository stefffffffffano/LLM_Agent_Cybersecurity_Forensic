[Task 1]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations, with a significant amount of data exchanged between the IP addresses 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2 on port 3000. This suggests that the service of interest might be running on port 3000. To identify the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic on this port to look for any specific application-layer protocols or signatures.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application-layer data from the traffic on port 3000 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 3000 revealed that the service involved is a web application or API. This conclusion is based on the presence of HTTP GET requests to 'localhost:3000' and the HTTP response status codes and content types observed. The service serves content types such as 'application/octet-stream,' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8,' and 'application/json; charset=UTF-8,' indicating a variety of content being served, including JSON and plain text. The HTTP status codes 200, 404, and 500 suggest typical web application behavior, with successful responses, not found errors, and server errors.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 3000 && http" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.content_type

Command output: 	
200	application/octet-stream
	
200	text/plain; charset=utf-8
	
200	text/plain; charset=utf-8
	
500	application/json; charset=UTF-8
	
200	text/plain; charset=utf-8
	
200	text/plain; charset=utf-8
	
200	text/plain; charset=utf-8
	
500	application/json; charset=UTF-8
	
500	application/json; charset=UTF-8
	
404	application/json; charset=UTF-8
	
404	application/json; charset=UTF-8
	
404	application/json; charset=UTF-8


Step 3: The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 3000 indicates that the service involved is a web application or API, as evidenced by the HTTP requests and responses observed. The next step is to identify any potential vulnerabilities or CVEs associated with this type of service. To do this, I will perform a web search to find any known CVEs related to web applications or APIs that could match the observed behavior in the PCAP file.

I will now perform a web search to find relevant CVEs associated with web applications or APIs.

Step 5: The web search results provided information on various CVEs related to web applications and APIs. Notably, CVE-2021-44228, also known as Log4Shell, was mentioned as a significant vulnerability impacting millions of systems worldwide. This CVE is associated with remote code execution vulnerabilities in web applications. Given the nature of the service identified in the PCAP file (a web application or API), CVE-2021-44228 could potentially be relevant.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to analyze the PCAP file for any signs of remote code execution attempts, which could indicate exploitation of CVE-2021-44228.
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying potential exploitation attempts related to CVE-2021-44228, specifically looking for signs of remote code execution attempts in the traffic on port 3000. Initial findings revealed HTTP requests with suspicious directory traversal patterns, which could indicate attempts to access sensitive files on the server. Further investigation aimed to identify specific payloads or headers containing the string 'jndi:', commonly associated with Log4j exploitation attempts. However, no such patterns were found in the traffic on port 3000, as the command to search for 'jndi:' in the frame data returned no output.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 3000 && frame contains \"jndi:\"" -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e frame.len

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 7: The analysis of the PCAP file did not reveal any signs of remote code execution attempts related to CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell), as no 'jndi:' patterns were found in the traffic on port 3000. This suggests that the specific exploitation attempt for this CVE was not present in the captured data. However, the presence of suspicious directory traversal patterns indicates potential attempts to access sensitive files on the server.

To further assess the situation, I will now evaluate whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack (CVE-2021-44228) and whether any other signs of malicious activity are present in the PCAP file. I will also consider other potential vulnerabilities that might be relevant to the observed behavior. 

Next, I will perform a web search to gather more information on potential vulnerabilities or attack patterns that could match the observed directory traversal attempts in the PCAP file.

Information 5: as Directory Traversal (CWE-35), is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files present on the server hosting a web application. In some cases, this vulnerability can even allow an attacker to write files or modify their paths, altering the behavior of the web application or, in the worst-case scenario, completely compromising the server. How does it work? Let’s imagine having a web application that allows users to search for images and display them on a page. After performing a search, 
Step 9: The web search results indicate that directory traversal vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on a server, which aligns with the suspicious directory traversal patterns observed in the PCAP file. This suggests that the web application or API might be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. To further investigate, I need to analyze the PCAP file for any specific directory traversal patterns or attempts to access sensitive files.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract any directory traversal patterns or attempts to access sensitive files from the PCAP file.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract HTTP requests with directory traversal patterns from traffic on port 3000. The initial approach was to use a filter with the 'contains' operator to detect '../' patterns in the HTTP request URI. However, this resulted in an error due to the incorrect use of the string '../' in the filter. Attempts to find guidance on using special characters and regular expressions in display filters through the manual search were unsuccessful. As a result, I was unable to find a valid command to extract the desired information from the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "http.request and tcp.port == 3000 and http.request.uri contains '../'" -T fields -e ip.src -e http.request.uri

Error in the command

Step 11: 
Step 12: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis successfully extracted HTTP requests and their URIs from traffic on port 3000. The output revealed multiple GET requests attempting directory traversal to access sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. This indicates potential directory traversal attacks.
Executed command: -Y "http.request && tcp.port == 3000" -T fields -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri

Step 15: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed multiple GET requests attempting directory traversal to access sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. This indicates potential directory traversal attacks. The next step is to assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to these directory traversal attacks and evaluate whether the attack was successful.

To proceed, I will use the "tshark_expert" to analyze the PCAP file for any signs of successful file access or data exfiltration attempts, which could indicate a successful directory traversal attack.
Step 16: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract HTTP response codes and content lengths for requests with directory traversal patterns. However, attempts to filter HTTP requests containing '../' using the 'contains' operator resulted in errors due to invalid character constants. Subsequent attempts to use regular expressions with the '~' operator also failed due to incorrect escape sequences for the dot character. Despite multiple corrections, the command continued to produce errors, indicating a persistent issue with the escape sequence handling in the filter expression. As a result, no output was obtained for the given command.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri ~ \"\.\.\/\"" -T fields -e http.request.uri -e http.response.code -e http.content_length

Step 17: 
Step 18: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying HTTP requests with directory traversal patterns, specifically looking for '../' in the URL path. The command executed successfully extracted HTTP response codes and content lengths for these requests. The results showed a mix of HTTP response codes, including 200 (OK), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 404 (Not Found), with varying content lengths. This indicates that some requests with directory traversal patterns were successful (200), while others resulted in errors (500) or were not found (404).
Executed command: -Y 'http.request.uri contains "../"' -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.content_length

Step 19: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed multiple GET requests attempting directory traversal to access sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. This indicates potential directory traversal attacks. The HTTP response codes for these requests include 200 (OK), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 404 (Not Found), suggesting that some of these directory traversal attempts were successful.

To finalize the analysis, I will now prepare the final report, including the CVE identifier, the affected service, and the assessment of whether the attack was successful and if the service is vulnerable.
Step 20: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple GET requests attempting directory traversal to access sensitive files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and others. This indicates potential directory traversal attacks. The HTTP response codes for these requests include 200 (OK), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 404 (Not Found), suggesting that some of these directory traversal attempts were successful. The service involved is a web application or API running on port 3000, which appears to be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.
