[Task 1]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations, with a significant amount of data exchanged between 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2 on port 3000. This suggests that the service of interest is likely running on port 3000. To identify the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic on this port to look for any specific application signatures or protocol details.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data or protocol details from the traffic on port 3000 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 3000 revealed that an HTTP service is running on this port. Multiple GET requests were made to 'localhost:3000' using a web browser with a specific user agent. Further analysis of HTTP response details showed a mix of HTTP status codes, including 200 (OK), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 404 (Not Found). This indicates that the service is responding to requests, but there are some errors and missing resources. The presence of HTTP traffic confirms that the service on port 3000 is likely a web application or server.

Step 3: The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 3000 revealed that an HTTP service is running on this port. The presence of HTTP traffic confirms that the service on port 3000 is likely a web application or server. Now, I need to identify any potential vulnerabilities or CVEs associated with this web application or server. To do this, I will perform a web search to find any known CVEs related to web applications or servers that could match the observed behavior, such as HTTP 500 errors or other anomalies.

Next, I will perform a web search to find CVEs associated with web applications or servers that could explain the observed behavior in the PCAP file.

Step 5: The web search results indicate that HTTP 500 errors are generic server-side errors that can be caused by various issues such as server misconfigurations, application code bugs, or database connection problems. However, they do not directly point to a specific CVE. To identify any potential vulnerabilities or CVEs associated with this web application or server, I need to analyze the HTTP traffic further for any specific patterns or anomalies that could indicate a known vulnerability.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract HTTP request and response headers from the traffic on port 3000 to look for any specific patterns or anomalies that could indicate a known vulnerability.
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the HTTP traffic on port 3000 revealed potential directory traversal attempts. The requests included URIs with patterns like '../../../../', indicating attempts to access sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files, and logs. The HTTP response codes varied, with some requests returning '200 OK', indicating successful access, while others returned '500 Internal Server Error' or '404 Not Found', indicating failed attempts. The attempt to extract additional HTTP headers like User-Agent failed due to an incorrect field name, and further exploration of the PCAP is not allowed.

Step 7: The analysis of the HTTP traffic on port 3000 revealed potential directory traversal attempts, with URIs containing patterns like '../../../../', indicating attempts to access sensitive files on the server. This behavior is indicative of a directory traversal vulnerability, which is a known security issue in web applications. To identify the specific CVE associated with this type of vulnerability, I will perform a web search for CVEs related to directory traversal attacks in web applications.
Step 8: Search result for query: 'CVE directory traversal web application'
Information 1: as Directory Traversal (CWE-35), is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files present on the server hosting a web application. In some cases, this vulnerability can even allow an attacker to write files or modify their paths, altering the behavior of the web application or, in the worst-case scenario, completely compromising the server. How does it work? Let’s imagine having a web application that allows users to search for images and display them on a page. After performing a search,

How It Works: CVE-Traversal scans target URLs for potential directory traversal vulnerabilities by injecting crafted payloads into URL parameters.

Step 12: The analysis of the HTTP traffic on port 3000 revealed potential directory traversal attempts, with URIs containing patterns like '../../../../', indicating attempts to access sensitive files on the server. This behavior is indicative of a directory traversal vulnerability, which is a known security issue in web applications. The web search results identified CVE-2023-2825 as a relevant CVE for directory traversal vulnerabilities in web applications.

Now, I need to assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. Based on the HTTP response codes, some requests returned '200 OK', indicating successful access to sensitive files, while others returned '500 Internal Server Error' or '404 Not Found', indicating failed attempts. This suggests that the service is vulnerable to the directory traversal attack, and some of the attack attempts were successful.

I will now format the final answer with the detailed report, CVE identifier, affected service, and the assessment of the attack's success and vulnerability.
Step 13: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the HTTP traffic on port 3000 revealed potential directory traversal attempts, with URIs containing patterns like '../../../../', indicating attempts to access sensitive files on the server. Some requests returned '200 OK', indicating successful access to sensitive files, while others returned '500 Internal Server Error' or '404 Not Found', indicating failed attempts. This suggests that the service is vulnerable to the directory traversal attack, and some of the attack attempts were successful.
