[Task 1]
Step 1: Report of the log analysis done by the log reporter:

1. **Summary of Relevant and Suspicious Events:**
   - The logs indicate a series of unauthorized access attempts to sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow`, `/root/.bash_history`, and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. These attempts resulted in permission denied errors, suggesting a potential directory traversal attack.
   - The requests were made using the path `/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../..//`, which is a common pattern for directory traversal exploits.
   - The source of these requests is from the IP address `172.18.0.1`.

2. **Service Involved:**
   - The service involved is Grafana, as indicated by multiple log entries such as `msg="Config loaded from" logger=settings file=/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` and `msg="HTTP Server Listen" logger=http.server address=[::]:3000 protocol=http`.
   - The logs suggest the use of Grafana 8, as referenced in the warning message about the `unified_alerting` section.

3. **Detection of Known Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Patterns:**
   - The directory traversal attempts are indicative of a known vulnerability pattern where attackers try to access files outside the web server's root directory. This is often exploited in web applications that do not properly sanitize user input.
   - The specific paths targeted, such as `/etc/shadow` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, are common targets for attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

4. **Log Excerpts Justifying Analysis:**
   - Unauthorized access attempts:
     ```
     t=2024-09-25T12:25:20+0000 lvl=eror msg="Could not open plugin file" logger=context userId=0 orgId=0 uname= error="open /etc/shadow: permission denied"
     t=2024-09-25T12:25:23+0000 lvl=eror msg="Could not open plugin file" logger=context userId=0 orgId=0 uname= error="open /root/.bash_history: permission denied"
     t=2024-09-25T12:25:24+0000 lvl=eror msg="Could not open plugin file" logger=context userId=0 orgId=0 uname= error="open /root/.ssh/authorized_keys: permission denied"
     ```
   - Directory traversal pattern:
     ```
     method=GET path=/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../..//etc/shadow
     ```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logs reveal suspicious activity consistent with a directory traversal attack targeting a Grafana service. The attempts to access sensitive files were unsuccessful due to permission restrictions, but the pattern of requests suggests an active exploitation attempt.
   - Further investigation is recommended, including reviewing network traffic from the IP `172.18.0.1` and ensuring that the Grafana instance is updated to the latest version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Step 2: Based on the log analysis, it appears that the service involved is Grafana, and there are indications of a directory traversal attack attempt. The network traffic summary shows multiple TCP connections between `172.18.0.1` and `172.18.0.2` on port 3000, which aligns with the Grafana service.

To further investigate, I will analyze the network traffic to look for signs of directory traversal attempts, such as specific HTTP requests that match the pattern observed in the logs (e.g., requests containing `../../../../../../../..//`). This will help confirm the presence of such attempts in the network traffic.

Let's proceed with this analysis.
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis successfully extracted HTTP requests and their headers, revealing multiple directory traversal patterns. The requests contained paths like '../../../../../../../..//', indicating attempts to access sensitive files on the server, such as '/etc/passwd', '/etc/shadow', and other critical system files. This suggests a potential security breach attempt through directory traversal.
