[Task 9]
Step 1: Based on the provided summary of the PCAP file, it appears that the traffic is primarily between two IP addresses, 172.18.0.3 and 172.18.0.2, over port 3306. Port 3306 is commonly associated with MySQL database services. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the packet contents to verify if MySQL traffic is indeed present.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract and analyze the packet contents to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file to confirm the service.
Step 2: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 3: The previous attempt to use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file did not complete successfully. To proceed, I will attempt to extract MySQL protocol details again to confirm the service involved.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file to confirm the service.
Step 4: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic in the PCAP file by extracting MySQL protocol details. Initially, a command was constructed to filter for MySQL protocol packets and display specific fields such as frame number, source IP, destination IP, and MySQL query fields. However, the output was too long, indicating a large number of MySQL packets. A refined command was executed to limit the output to the first 20 packets, but it resulted in no output. This suggests that the filter might not be correctly capturing the MySQL traffic, or the fields specified are not present in the packets. Despite searching the manual for MySQL protocol field names and filter syntax, no adjustments were made that resulted in output. Therefore, the final result is that no MySQL protocol details were extracted from the PCAP file using the attempted commands.
Executed command: tshark -Y "mysql" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e mysql.query -c 20

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 5: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful. This suggests that the filter might not be correctly capturing the MySQL traffic, or the fields specified are not present in the packets. To proceed, I need to verify the presence of MySQL traffic by analyzing the packet contents more thoroughly.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract general TCP packet details from the PCAP file to identify any MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies. This will help confirm the presence of MySQL traffic and guide further analysis.

High level description of the analysis objective: Extract general TCP packet details to identify MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.port -e tcp.flags -e tcp.len -c 50
Step 6: 
Step 7: Network error while processing
Step 8: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful, and the network error while processing the general TCP packet details suggests that there might be an issue with the network or the command execution. To proceed, I will attempt to extract general TCP packet details again to identify any MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies. This will help confirm the presence of MySQL traffic and guide further analysis.

Step 10: Network error while processing
Step 11: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol details and general TCP packet details from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful due to network errors. To proceed, I will attempt to extract general TCP packet details again to identify any MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies. This will help confirm the presence of MySQL traffic and guide further analysis.

Step 14: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract general TCP packet details to identify MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies. Initially, a command was executed to list TCP packets with their details, but the output was too long. The command was refined to limit the output to the first 20 packets, which showed TCP handshake and connection reset processes. To focus on data transfer patterns, a filter for non-zero TCP length was applied, but it returned no output. This suggests there might not be any TCP packets with data transfer in the PCAP file, or there might be an issue with the filter syntax. However, the manual search confirmed the filter syntax was correct, indicating the absence of data transfer packets.
Executed command: -Y "tcp && tcp.len > 0" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.srcport -e tcp.dstport -e tcp.flags -e tcp.len -c 20

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 15: The previous attempts to extract MySQL protocol details and general TCP packet details from the PCAP file using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful due to network errors. Since the network errors persist, I will attempt to use a different approach to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic. I will search for any MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies in the packet contents by analyzing the packet payloads directly.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract packet payloads from the PCAP file to identify any MySQL-specific patterns or anomalies. This will help confirm the presence of MySQL traffic and guide further analysis.
