[Task 4]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations, with a significant amount of traffic between 172.18.0.2 and 52.202.51.185 on port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS. There is also notable traffic between 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2 on port 8080, which is often used for web services or applications. 

To identify the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic on port 8080 to see if there are any HTTP requests or other identifiable patterns that can reveal the service or application name.

Action: I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the traffic on port 8080 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis successfully extracted HTTP requests and their headers from traffic on port 8080. All requests were POST requests to 'localhost:8080' with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0' and the URI '/cli?remoting=false'.
Executed command: -Y "http.request && tcp.port == 8080" -T fields -e http.request.method -e http.host -e http.user_agent -e http.request.uri

Command output: POST	localhost:8080	python-requests/2.22.0	/cli?remoting=false

POST	localhost:8080	python-requests/2.22.0	/cli?remoting=false
POST	localhost:8080	python-requests/2.22.0	/cli?remoting=false
POST	localhost:8080	python-requests/2.22.0	/cli?remoting=false
POST	localhost:8080	python-requests/2.22.0	/cli?remoting=false


Step 3: The extracted HTTP requests indicate that the traffic on port 8080 involves POST requests to 'localhost:8080' with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0' and the URI '/cli?remoting=false'. This pattern suggests that the service or application involved might be Jenkins, as Jenkins often uses the '/cli' endpoint for command-line interface operations, and the 'remoting=false' parameter is commonly associated with Jenkins CLI operations.

To proceed, I need to identify any relevant CVEs associated with Jenkins that could be exploited through this type of traffic pattern. I will perform a web search to find CVEs related to Jenkins, particularly those that might involve the CLI or similar endpoints. 

Action: I will use the web search tool to find CVEs associated with Jenkins, focusing on vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the CLI or similar endpoints.

Step 5: The web search results indicate that the traffic pattern observed in the PCAP file is associated with Jenkins, specifically involving the Jenkins CLI. The relevant CVE identified is CVE-2024-23897, which allows for unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a feature in Jenkins' command-line interface (CLI). This vulnerability could lead to a full system compromise.

To gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE, I need to analyze the PCAP file for signs of remote code execution attempts, such as unusual command execution patterns or attempts to access sensitive files.

Action: I will use the "tshark_expert" to search for signs of remote code execution attempts in the PCAP file, focusing on command execution patterns or attempts to access sensitive files.
Step 6: 
Step 7: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying potential remote code execution attempts by examining HTTP POST requests to the URI '/cli?remoting=false'. The POST data extracted from these requests was in hexadecimal format, which suggested it might contain encoded or binary data. Attempts to decode this data using the '-e data.text' field did not yield any output, and further searches in the tshark manual did not provide alternative methods for decoding. Therefore, the analysis could not conclusively identify command execution patterns or file access attempts from the available data.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.method == POST" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 8: The analysis of the PCAP file has identified that the traffic pattern is associated with Jenkins, specifically involving the Jenkins CLI. The relevant CVE identified is CVE-2024-23897, which allows for unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a feature in Jenkins' command-line interface (CLI). However, the analysis could not conclusively identify command execution patterns or file access attempts from the available data.

To proceed, I need to determine whether the Jenkins service is vulnerable to this CVE and if the attack was successful. Since the analysis could not find conclusive evidence of exploitation, I will need to assess the vulnerability based on the Jenkins version and other contextual information.

Action: I will perform a web search to find information on how to determine if a Jenkins instance is vulnerable to CVE-2024-23897 and any indicators of a successful attack.

Step 12: The search results indicate that Jenkins versions 2.0 to 2.441 and Jenkins LTS versions 2.7.1 to 2.426.2 are affected by CVE-2024-23897. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. The presence of a public exploit tool for this CVE suggests that the attack complexity is low, and there are no specific indicators of a successful attack mentioned in the search results.

Given this information, I need to determine if the Jenkins instance in the PCAP file is within the affected version range and assess if there are any indicators of a successful attack.

Action: I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract any HTTP response headers or server information from the PCAP file that might reveal the Jenkins version. This will help determine if the instance is vulnerable to CVE-2024-23897.
Step 13: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis successfully extracted the HTTP response headers from traffic on port 8080. The 'X-Jenkins' header was found, indicating the Jenkins version as '2.441'. The 'Server' header also showed 'Jetty(10.0.18)', but the primary focus was on identifying the Jenkins version, which was achieved.

Step 14: 
Step 15: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed that the traffic pattern is associated with Jenkins, specifically involving the Jenkins CLI. The relevant CVE identified is CVE-2024-23897, which allows for unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a feature in Jenkins' command-line interface (CLI). The Jenkins version identified in the PCAP file is 2.441, which is within the affected range for this CVE. Although the analysis could not conclusively identify command execution patterns or file access attempts from the available data, the presence of a public exploit tool and the low attack complexity suggest a high risk of exploitation. However, without specific indicators of a successful attack, it cannot be confirmed if the attack was successful.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2024-23897
Affected Service: Jenkins
Is Service Vulnerable: True
Attack succeeded: False
