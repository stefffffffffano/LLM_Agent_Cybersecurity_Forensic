[Task 4]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations, with a significant amount of traffic between 172.18.0.2 and 52.202.51.185 on port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS. There is also notable traffic between 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2 on port 8080, which is often used for web services or applications. 

Given the context, the next logical step is to analyze the traffic on port 8080 to identify the service or application involved. This will help in determining if there is any specific service running on this port that could be associated with a known CVE.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the traffic on port 8080 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers from traffic on port 8080. The command was designed to filter for HTTP requests and display relevant fields such as host, request method, request URI, and user agent. The output revealed multiple HTTP POST requests to the URI '/cli?remoting=false' on 'localhost:8080', all using the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. This indicates that the service or application involved is likely being accessed or tested using a Python script with the 'requests' library.
Executed command: -Y "http.request && tcp.port == 8080" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent

Command output: localhost:8080	POST	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0

localhost:8080	POST	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0
localhost:8080	POST	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0
localhost:8080	POST	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0

Step 3: The analysis of the HTTP requests on port 8080 revealed multiple POST requests to the URI '/cli?remoting=false' using the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. This suggests that the service or application involved is likely being accessed or tested using a Python script with the 'requests' library. The URI '/cli?remoting=false' is often associated with Jenkins, a popular open-source automation server.

To proceed, I need to identify any known CVEs associated with Jenkins that could be relevant to this traffic pattern. I will perform a web search to find CVEs related to Jenkins, particularly those that might involve the '/cli?remoting=false' endpoint or similar patterns. 

Action: Perform a web search for CVEs associated with Jenkins, focusing on those that might involve the '/cli?remoting=false' endpoint or similar patterns.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'Jenkins CVE /cli?remoting=false'

With a CVSS score of 9.8, unauthorized access to files through the CLI is possible, potentially leading to RCE. In addition to file access, CVE-2024-23897 can be leveraged to access binary files that contain cryptographic keys utilized for various Jenkins functionalities, albeit with certain limitations. Unauthorized access to this sensitive information can result in: RCE through the exploitation of resource root URLs RCE by
Information 4: he vulnerable Jenkins server. An example of a simple exploit involves using the CLI to execute a command that reads files on the system or verifies the current Jenkins user permissions. However, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to access sensitive system files like /etc/passwd. For example: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://jenkins-server:8080 -http connect-node “@/etc/passwd” POC Video:- Reference: https://www.firecompass.com/jenkins-cve-2024-23897-vulnerability-exposed/ Share: Post navigation C

Step 5: The web search results indicate that there is a known CVE related to Jenkins, specifically CVE-2024-23897, which involves unauthorized access to files through the CLI, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE). This CVE is associated with the Jenkins integrated command line interfaces (CLI) and has a high CVSS score of 9.8. The vulnerability can be exploited to access sensitive system files and execute commands.

Given this information, the next step is to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE in the PCAP file. This involves looking for signs of unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to analyze the PCAP file for signs of unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI, focusing on the '/cli?remoting=false' endpoint.
Step 6: 
Step 7: Network error while processing
Step 8: 
Step 9: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to filter HTTP requests targeting the '/cli?remoting=false' endpoint failed due to an incorrect filter syntax. The error indicated that the filter string was too long to be a valid character constant. Upon reviewing the tshark manual, it was found that special characters in URI paths need to be handled carefully. However, due to the constraints of the task, further exploration of the PCAP file was not possible. Therefore, the analysis could not be completed as intended.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri contains '/cli?remoting=false'" -T fields -e ip.src -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri

Command output: Error: Command '['tshark', '-r', 'C:\\Users\\Stefano\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic\\src\\data\\raw\\eventID_4\\CVE-2024-23897.pcap', '-Y', "http.request.uri contains '/cli?remoting=false'", '-T', 'fields', '-e', 'ip.src', '-e', 'http.request.method', '-e', 'http.request.uri']' returned non-zero exit status 4. tshark: '/cli?remoting=false' is too long to be a valid character constant. http.request.uri contains '/cli?remoting=false' ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 10: The previous attempt to analyze the PCAP file for signs of unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI failed due to an incorrect filter syntax. To proceed, I need to correct the filter syntax and attempt the analysis again. 

Action: Use the tshark_expert to analyze the PCAP file for signs of unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI, focusing on the '/cli?remoting=false' endpoint. I will ensure the filter syntax is correct this time.
Step 11: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying HTTP requests targeting the Jenkins CLI endpoint '/cli?remoting=false'. The command executed successfully, revealing multiple POST requests to this endpoint. The presence of HTTP 500 Server Error and HTTP 200 OK responses suggests potential unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI.
Executed command: -Y 'http.request.uri contains "/cli?remoting=false"'

Step 12: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed multiple POST requests to the Jenkins CLI endpoint '/cli?remoting=false', with responses indicating both HTTP 500 Server Error and HTTP 200 OK. This suggests potential unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI, which aligns with the characteristics of CVE-2024-23897. This CVE involves unauthorized access to files through the Jenkins CLI, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).

Given this information, I will now proceed to format the final answer, summarizing the findings and assessing the vulnerability and success of the attack.
Step 13: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple POST requests to the Jenkins CLI endpoint '/cli?remoting=false', with responses indicating both HTTP 500 Server Error and HTTP 200 OK. This suggests potential unauthorized access attempts or command execution through the Jenkins CLI. The traffic pattern aligns with CVE-2024-23897, which involves unauthorized access to files through the Jenkins CLI, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).
