[Task 4]
Step 1: Based on the provided summary of the PCAP file, there are multiple TCP conversations involving the IP address 172.18.0.2 on port 8080. This suggests that there might be a web service running on this port, possibly an HTTP service. To confirm the service running on port 8080, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file. This will help identify the service or application involved.

Let's proceed with this step.

High level description of the analysis objective: Extract HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application running on port 8080.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "http" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application running on port 8080. The initial command was corrected to include a filter for traffic on port 8080. The output revealed multiple HTTP requests to `localhost:8080` with the URI `/cli?remoting=false` and the user agent `python-requests/2.22.0`, indicating that the service is being accessed programmatically using the Python `requests` library.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "http && tcp.port == 8080" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent

Command output: localhost:8080	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0

	/cli?remoting=false	
	/cli?remoting=false	
localhost:8080	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0
localhost:8080	/cli?remoting=false	python-requests/2.22.0
	/cli?remoting=false	
	/cli?remoting=false	

Step 3: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed that there are multiple HTTP requests to `localhost:8080` with the URI `/cli?remoting=false` and the user agent `python-requests/2.22.0`. This suggests that the service running on port 8080 is being accessed programmatically using the Python `requests` library. The URI `/cli?remoting=false` could be indicative of a specific application or service, possibly related to a command-line interface or remote management feature.

To proceed, I need to identify the service or application that uses this specific URI pattern. Once identified, I can search for CVEs related to that service or application. 

I will perform a web search to identify the service or application associated with the URI `/cli?remoting=false`.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'service or application using /cli?remoting=false'
Information 1: ed only if they were still using the -remoting CLI flag, since the default has long been to use HTTP(S) mode. Most CLI features have long worked fine without -remoting, in some cases using slightly different syntax such as requiring shell redirects to access local files. As part of this change, some CLI commands, options, and option types in Jenkins core have been removed, other than -remoting itself: The login and logout commands, and the --username and --password options. The -p option to select a proxy. 
Information 2: ck a developer’s laptop if -remoting were used. The 2.46.x upgrade guide already urged administrators to disable Remoting mode on the server.

Step 5: The web search results indicate that the URI pattern `/cli?remoting=false` is associated with Jenkins, specifically related to its command-line interface (CLI) and remoting features. Jenkins is a well-known automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

Now that we have identified Jenkins as the service running on port 8080, the next step is to search for CVEs related to Jenkins. This will help us identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the captured traffic.

I will perform a web search to find CVEs associated with Jenkins.

Step 7: The analysis has identified Jenkins as the service running on port 8080, and a list of CVEs associated with Jenkins has been found. The next step is to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified CVEs. Since Jenkins is known for its vulnerabilities related to remote code execution, command injection, and other security issues, I need to look for signs of such activities in the network traffic.

To proceed, I will ask the tshark_expert to extract any HTTP POST requests that might be indicative of command execution attempts or other suspicious activities. This will help in identifying any potential exploitation attempts in the captured traffic.

Let's proceed with this step.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP POST requests from Jenkins traffic on port 8080 to identify potential command execution attempts. The initial command had an error due to incorrect use of single quotes around 'POST'. After correcting the command to use double quotes, the execution revealed multiple HTTP POST requests to the URI `/cli?remoting=false`, indicating repeated access attempts to a specific endpoint on the Jenkins server.
Executed command: tshark -Y "http.request.method == \"POST\" && tcp.port == 8080" -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e http.request.uri

Step 9: The analysis has identified Jenkins as the service running on port 8080, and a list of CVEs associated with Jenkins has been found. The next step is to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified CVEs. Since Jenkins is known for its vulnerabilities related to remote code execution, command injection, and other security issues, I need to look for signs of such activities in the network traffic.

To proceed, I will ask the tshark_expert to extract any HTTP POST requests that might be indicative of command execution attempts or other suspicious activities. This will help in identifying any potential exploitation attempts in the captured traffic.

Let's proceed with this step.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial command to extract HTTP POST requests from Jenkins traffic on port 8080 was incorrect due to the use of single quotes around the HTTP method 'POST'. This was corrected by using double quotes, allowing the command to execute successfully. The output revealed multiple HTTP POST requests to the Jenkins CLI endpoint, which could indicate potential command execution attempts.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.method == \"POST\" && tcp.port == 8080" -T fields -e ip.src -e http.host -e http.request.uri

Step 11: Based on the analysis so far, we have identified Jenkins as the service running on port 8080. We have also found multiple HTTP POST requests to the Jenkins CLI endpoint, which could indicate potential command execution attempts. The next step is to assess whether the Jenkins service is vulnerable to any of the identified CVEs and evaluate whether the attack was successful.

To proceed, I will perform a web search to find specific details about the CVEs related to Jenkins, focusing on those that involve remote code execution or command injection vulnerabilities. This will help us determine if the observed traffic matches any known exploitation patterns.

Step 19: 
Step 20: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed that Jenkins is the service running on port 8080. Multiple HTTP POST requests were observed to the Jenkins CLI endpoint, which could indicate potential command execution attempts. A web search identified CVE-2024-23897 as a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting Jenkins, specifically through its command-line interface (CLI). This vulnerability allows for unauthorized remote code execution by exploiting a feature in Jenkins' CLI, which could lead to a full system compromise. The repeated access attempts to the Jenkins CLI endpoint in the captured traffic suggest that the service is vulnerable to this CVE. However, without further evidence of successful exploitation, it is unclear if the attack was successful.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2024-23897
Affected Service: Jenkins
Is Service Vulnerable: True
Attack succeeded: False
