[Task 17]
Step 1: Report of the log analysis done by the log reporter:

1. **Summary of Relevant and Suspicious Events:**
   - The log indicates the startup of an Apache ActiveMQ service, version 5.14.2.
   - Multiple connectors are started, including TCP, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket, each with a maximum connection limit of 1000 and a maximum frame size of 100 MB.
   - A warning is issued regarding uncovered HTTP methods for the root path, which could potentially expose the service to unauthorized access or attacks.
   - There are warnings about insufficient disk space for the store and temporary store limits, which have been reset to the maximum available space of 2769 MB.
   - A critical warning is logged: "Transport Connection to: tcp://172.18.0.1:55040 failed: java.io.IOException: Frame size of 1 GB larger than max allowed 100 MB." This indicates an attempt to send a frame significantly larger than the configured maximum, which could be indicative of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or an attempt to exploit a vulnerability.

2. **Service Involved:**
   - The service involved is Apache ActiveMQ, version 5.14.2.

3. **Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Patterns:**
   - The warning about uncovered HTTP methods for the root path ("/") suggests a potential security misconfiguration that could be exploited.
   - The frame size warning suggests a possible attempt to exploit a vulnerability related to frame size handling, which could be used for DoS attacks or to bypass security controls.

4. **Log Excerpts for Justification:**
   - "WARN | ServletContext@o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@b978d10{/,null,STARTING} has uncovered http methods for path: /"
   - "WARN | Transport Connection to: tcp://172.18.0.1:55040 failed: java.io.IOException: Frame size of 1 GB larger than max allowed 100 MB"

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The log provides evidence of potential security issues, including uncovered HTTP methods and an attempt to send an oversized frame. These events should be correlated with network traffic data to determine if they are part of a larger attack pattern or exploitation attempt. Further investigation into the configuration and security posture of the ActiveMQ service is recommended to mitigate these risks.
Step 2: The log analysis indicates that the service involved is Apache ActiveMQ, version 5.14.2. There are warnings about uncovered HTTP methods and an attempt to send an oversized frame, which could be indicative of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or an attempt to exploit a vulnerability related to frame size handling.

To further investigate, I need to analyze the network traffic to look for signs of oversized frames or any anomalies that could correlate with the log warnings. This will help in gathering evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified potential vulnerabilities.

Let's proceed with analyzing the network traffic for any signs of oversized frames or anomalies.
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP traffic between 172.18.0.1:55040 and 172.18.0.2:61616 revealed no anomalies. The frame sizes were small, and there were no signs of retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, zero window, window size updates, or connection resets. The traffic appears to be normal and free of any oversized frames or anomalies.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.flags.reset==1" -T fields -e frame.number -e tcp.flags.reset

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 4: The analysis of the TCP traffic between the two IP addresses did not reveal any anomalies or oversized frames, which suggests that the network traffic appears normal. However, the log analysis indicated potential security issues with Apache ActiveMQ, including uncovered HTTP methods and an attempt to send an oversized frame. 

To proceed, I need to verify if there are any known vulnerabilities related to Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.2 that could be associated with the observed log warnings. This will help in identifying the relevant CVE and assessing the potential risk.

Let's perform a web search to find any CVEs associated with Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.2, particularly those related to frame size handling or HTTP method exposure.
Step 5: Search result for query: 'CVE Apache ActiveMQ 5.14.2 frame size HTTP methods'

Step 8: The web search results did not provide any specific CVEs related to Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.2 that match the observed log warnings about frame size handling or HTTP method exposure. However, the log analysis indicates potential security issues with uncovered HTTP methods and an attempt to send an oversized frame, which could be indicative of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or an attempt to exploit a vulnerability.

To gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified potential vulnerabilities, I need to further analyze the network traffic for any signs of HTTP method exposure or anomalies related to frame size handling.

Let's proceed with analyzing the network traffic for any signs of HTTP method exposure or anomalies related to frame size handling.
Step 9: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis revealed that the traffic in the PCAP file is not HTTP but rather uses the Openwire protocol, which is associated with ActiveMQ, a message broker service. This explains the absence of HTTP requests and methods in the previous attempts. The task of extracting HTTP requests and their methods is not applicable to this PCAP file due to the lack of HTTP traffic.

Step 10: The analysis of the network traffic revealed that the traffic in the PCAP file is not HTTP but rather uses the Openwire protocol, which is associated with ActiveMQ, a message broker service. This explains the absence of HTTP requests and methods in the previous attempts. The task of extracting HTTP requests and their methods is not applicable to this PCAP file due to the lack of HTTP traffic.

Given this, I need to focus on analyzing the Openwire protocol traffic for any signs of anomalies related to frame size handling, as this could correlate with the log warnings about an attempt to send an oversized frame.

Let's proceed with analyzing the Openwire protocol traffic for any signs of anomalies related to frame size handling.
Step 11: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on Openwire protocol traffic on port 61616, specifically looking for anomalies related to frame size handling. Frame 8 was identified as containing 'OpenWire (WireFormatInfo)', and detailed inspection revealed a MaxFrameSize of 104857600. This value is significant and indicates the maximum allowable frame size. The frames captured in the PCAP do not exceed this size, suggesting no anomalies related to frame size handling were detected in the provided data.

Step 12: The analysis of the Openwire protocol traffic on port 61616 revealed that the frames captured in the PCAP do not exceed the maximum allowable frame size of 104857600, indicating no anomalies related to frame size handling. This suggests that the network traffic appears normal and free of any oversized frames or anomalies.

Given the absence of specific CVEs related to Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.2 that match the observed log warnings, and the normal network traffic, it seems that the potential vulnerabilities identified in the log analysis were not exploited in this instance.

To conclude the analysis, I will compile the final report based on the findings.
Step 13: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.2, specifically looking for signs of oversized frames or anomalies related to frame size handling. The network traffic was found to be normal, with no frames exceeding the maximum allowable size. The log analysis indicated potential security issues with uncovered HTTP methods and an attempt to send an oversized frame, but these were not observed in the network traffic. No specific CVEs related to the observed log warnings were identified, and the service appears to be operating normally without signs of exploitation.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: N/A
Affected Service: Apache ActiveMQ
Is Service Vulnerable: False
Attack succeeded: False
