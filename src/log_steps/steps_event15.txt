[Task 15]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations, primarily involving traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.4, 172.18.0.3, and 172.18.0.2 on port 2379. This port is commonly associated with etcd, a distributed key-value store used in many cloud and container environments. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the packet contents to verify if etcd or another service is indeed running on this port.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 2379 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 2379 revealed that the application layer data involves HTTP requests and responses. Specifically, there are POST requests to endpoints like `/v3/watch` and `/v3/lease/grant`, and HTTP responses with status `200 OK`. This indicates that the service or application involved is likely an HTTP-based API, possibly etcd, which is known to use port 2379 for client communication.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 2379" -T fields -e text

Step 3: The analysis of the PCAP file indicates that the service involved is likely etcd, as evidenced by the HTTP-based API requests to endpoints like `/v3/watch` and `/v3/lease/grant` on port 2379. The next step is to identify any relevant CVEs associated with etcd that could be exploited through HTTP requests to these endpoints.

I will perform a web search to find CVEs related to etcd, particularly those that might involve HTTP API vulnerabilities.

Step 7: The analysis of the PCAP file and the web search results indicate that the service involved is etcd, and there is a known vulnerability related to the etcd HTTP API being accessible without authentication. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information exposure and unauthorized changes or deletions of data. The next step is to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE in the PCAP file.

I will use the "tshark_expert" to search for signs of unauthorized access or data manipulation in the PCAP file, which could indicate exploitation of the unauthenticated HTTP API vulnerability in etcd.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of HTTP requests and responses on port 2379 revealed multiple POST requests to the "/v3/watch" endpoint and a few to "/v3/lease/grant" and "/v3/kv/put". All HTTP responses were "200 OK", indicating that the requests were successfully processed. No other HTTP response codes were found, suggesting no unauthorized access or data manipulation attempts based on the HTTP response codes.
Executed command: -Y "http.response && tcp.port == 2379" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase

Command output: 200	OK

Step 9: The analysis of the PCAP file and the web search results indicate that the service involved is etcd, and there is a known vulnerability related to the etcd HTTP API being accessible without authentication. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information exposure and unauthorized changes or deletions of data. The analysis of HTTP requests and responses on port 2379 revealed multiple POST requests to the "/v3/watch" endpoint and a few to "/v3/lease/grant" and "/v3/kv/put". All HTTP responses were "200 OK", indicating that the requests were successfully processed. No other HTTP response codes were found, suggesting no unauthorized access or data manipulation attempts based on the HTTP response codes.

Now, I will proceed to provide the final answer based on the gathered information.
Step 10: FINAL REPORT:
The service involved is etcd, which was identified through HTTP-based API requests to endpoints like /v3/watch and /v3/lease/grant on port 2379. A known vulnerability related to the etcd HTTP API being accessible without authentication was identified. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information exposure and unauthorized changes or deletions of data. However, the analysis of HTTP requests and responses on port 2379 revealed that all requests were successfully processed with '200 OK' responses, indicating no signs of unauthorized access or data manipulation attempts.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2021-28235
Affected Service: etcd
Is Service Vulnerable: True
Attack succeeded: False
