[Task 2]
Step 1: Report of the log analysis done by the log reporter:

1. **Summary of Relevant and Suspicious Events:**
   - The log entries indicate multiple attempts to access sensitive files on the server using directory traversal techniques. The requests are encoded to bypass basic security filters.
   - Successful access to `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/group` was achieved, as indicated by the HTTP 200 status codes.
   - Attempts to access `/etc/shadow`, `/root/.bash_history`, and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` were denied, resulting in HTTP 403 status codes.
   - Attempts to access `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`, and `/var/www/html/config.php` resulted in HTTP 404 status codes, indicating these files were not found.
   - A potentially critical event is the POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, which returned a 200 status code, suggesting possible remote code execution or shell access.

2. **Service Involved:**
   - The log format and the presence of `/cgi-bin/` suggest that the service involved is likely an Apache HTTP Server. The specific version is not identifiable from the log entries alone.

3. **Detection of Known Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Patterns:**
   - The directory traversal attempts are indicative of attempts to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities, which are common in web servers that do not properly sanitize input paths.
   - The POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` is a classic pattern for attempting to exploit CGI scripts to gain shell access, potentially related to vulnerabilities like Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) if the server is running a vulnerable version of Bash.

4. **Excerpts Justifying Analysis:**
   - Directory traversal attempts: `"GET /icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 200 926`
   - Potential remote code execution: `"POST /cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh HTTP/1.1" 200 1`

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The log entries reveal suspicious activities that include successful directory traversal attacks and a potential remote code execution attempt. These should be correlated with the full packet capture to confirm the exploitation and assess the impact on the server. Further investigation into the server's configuration and patch level is recommended to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities.
Step 2: The log analysis suggests that the service involved is likely an Apache HTTP Server, and there are indications of directory traversal and potential remote code execution attempts. The POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` with a 200 status code is particularly concerning, as it suggests possible shell access. This pattern is reminiscent of attempts to exploit CGI scripts, potentially related to vulnerabilities like Shellshock.

To further investigate, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to confirm the presence of these suspicious activities and gather more evidence. 

Let's proceed with this analysis. 

Action: Use the tshark_expert to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file.
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple HTTP GET requests attempting directory traversal attacks targeting sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. Additionally, a POST request was identified targeting `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, which suggests a potential command injection attempt. The detailed HTTP headers and payloads were extracted to confirm these activities.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -V

Step 4: The analysis of the PCAP file has confirmed the presence of multiple HTTP GET requests attempting directory traversal attacks targeting sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. Additionally, a POST request was identified targeting `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, which suggests a potential command injection attempt. This pattern is reminiscent of attempts to exploit CGI scripts, potentially related to vulnerabilities like Shellshock.

To proceed, I need to verify the specific CVE associated with the observed behavior and gather more information about the vulnerability. I will perform a web search to find the latest information on the CVE related to the observed network behavior, particularly focusing on the Shellshock vulnerability. 

Action: Perform a web search to find the latest information on the CVE related to the Shellshock vulnerability.

This flaw arises from Bash’s incorrect processing of commands 
Information 3: owing the disclosure.[11][12] Because of the potential to compromise millions of unpatched systems, Shellshock was compared to the Heartbleed bug in its severity.[3][13] Background[edit] The Shellshock bug affects Bash, a program that various Unix-based systems use to execute command lines and command scripts. It is often installed as the system's default command-line interface. Analysis of the source code history of Bash shows the bug was introduced on 5 August 1989, and released in Bash version 1.03 on 1

Step 9: The web search confirmed that the observed network behavior is related to the Shellshock vulnerability, specifically CVE-2014-6271. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands due to incorrect processing of commands in Bash versions 1.03 through 4.3. The PCAP analysis has already shown evidence of directory traversal and potential command injection attempts, which align with the exploitation patterns of Shellshock.

Now, I need to assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. To do this, I will review the HTTP response codes and any server responses to the suspicious requests to determine if the attack was executed successfully.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to extract HTTP response codes and server responses from the PCAP file to assess the success of the attack.
Step 10: 
Step 11: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a mix of HTTP response codes, indicating varying levels of success for the requests. The presence of '200 OK' responses suggests successful requests, while '403 Forbidden' and '404 Not Found' responses indicate blocked or failed requests. This information can be used to assess the success of the attack and understand which requests were allowed or denied by the server.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase

Command output: 200	OK
403	Forbidden
200	OK
200	OK
200	OK
403	Forbidden
403	Forbidden
404	Not Found
404	Not Found
404	Not Found
200	OK


Step 12: 
Step 13: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple HTTP GET requests attempting directory traversal attacks targeting sensitive files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and others. Additionally, a POST request was identified targeting /cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh, which suggests a potential command injection attempt. The HTTP response codes indicate that some requests were successful, as evidenced by '200 OK' responses, while others were blocked or failed, as indicated by '403 Forbidden' and '404 Not Found' responses. This behavior aligns with the exploitation patterns of the Shellshock vulnerability, specifically CVE-2014-6271, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands due to incorrect processing of commands in Bash versions 1.03 through 4.3.
