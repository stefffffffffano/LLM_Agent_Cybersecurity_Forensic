[Task 2]
Step 1: Based on the summary of the TCP conversations, it appears that the traffic is primarily between two IP addresses, 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2, over port 80. This suggests that the traffic is likely HTTP traffic, which is commonly associated with web services or applications.

To confirm the presence of an HTTP service and gather more details about the application or service involved, I will analyze the HTTP requests and responses within the PCAP file. This will help identify the specific service or application being used.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved. The initial command was refined to include additional HTTP headers such as `http.referer`, `http.accept`, and `http.content_type`. The `http.content_type` field was populated for the POST request, indicating form data with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Other fields like `http.referer` and `http.accept` were not present in the captured requests.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.method -e http.user_agent -e http.referer -e http.accept -e http.content_type

Command output: localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	GET				
localhost	POST				application/x-www-form-urlencoded


Step 3: The HTTP requests extracted from the PCAP file indicate that the traffic is directed to "localhost" with multiple GET requests and a single POST request containing form data with the content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". This suggests that the service or application involved is likely a web application running on the local server.

To further identify the specific service or application, I will now focus on analyzing the POST request's payload to see if it contains any identifiable patterns or data that could indicate the application or service being used.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to extract the payload of the POST request from the PCAP file.
Step 4: 
Step 5: Final report from the forensic expert:
To extract the payload of the HTTP POST request, I refined the command to filter for HTTP POST requests using the display filter `http.request.method == "POST"` and extracted the payload data using the field `http.file_data`. This allowed us to focus specifically on the POST request payloads, which is crucial for identifying any patterns or data that could indicate the application or service being used.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.method == \"POST\"" -T fields -e http.file_data

Command output: 6563686f3b6563686f

Step 6: The extracted payload of the HTTP POST request is "6563686f3b6563686f". This appears to be hexadecimal data. To understand the content of this payload, I will convert it from hexadecimal to ASCII to see if it reveals any identifiable patterns or data that could indicate the application or service being used.

Action: Convert the hexadecimal payload "6563686f3b6563686f" to ASCII.
Step 7: 
Step 8: Stored memory bf2fc19d-b609-4413-ab84-9ea776e656c5
Step 9: The hexadecimal payload "6563686f3b6563686f" was converted to ASCII, resulting in the string "echo;echo". This pattern suggests that the payload might be attempting to execute shell commands, which could be indicative of a command injection attack. 

To further investigate, I will now perform a web search to identify any CVEs related to command injection vulnerabilities, particularly those that might be associated with web applications or services. This will help in determining if there is a known vulnerability that matches the observed behavior.

Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271)Shellshock was a critical vulnerability in the Bash shell that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating environment variables.Exploit example:curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; echo 'Vulnerable'" http://target.com/cgi-bin/vulnerable_script2. Cisco WebEx Client Vulnerability (CVE-2017-3823)A command injection vulnerability in Cisco WebEx client allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands when a user open
Step 11: The extracted payload "echo;echo" suggests a command injection attempt, which is a common web vulnerability. The web search results indicate that command injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. One notable example is the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), which allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating environment variables.

Given the context of the analysis, the traffic is directed to "localhost" with HTTP requests, and the payload suggests a command injection attempt. This aligns with the characteristics of a web application vulnerability.

To proceed, I will now assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. This will involve analyzing the network traffic for any signs of successful command execution or system compromise. 

I will use the tshark_expert to look for any signs of command execution or system responses that indicate a successful attack.
Step 12: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the network traffic revealed signs of a command injection attempt. The HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` with a `200 OK` response contained a payload in hexadecimal format, which translates to `echo;echo` in ASCII. This suggests that the attacker was attempting to execute the `echo` command on the server, indicating a potential command injection vulnerability.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.method == POST" -T fields -e frame.number -e http.file_data

Command output: 107	6563686f3b6563686f

Step 13: 
Step 14: Final report from the forensic expert:
The suggested tshark command was missing the initial 'tshark' command and the '-r <pcap_file>' option to specify the input file. After verifying the fields and options used in the suggested command, I executed the corrected command to analyze the network traffic for any signs of successful command execution or system compromise, focusing on responses to the HTTP POST request that might indicate a successful command injection attack.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "http.response" -T fields -e frame.number -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase -e http.file_data

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 15: Based on the analysis so far, the HTTP POST request payload "echo;echo" suggests a command injection attempt, which is a common web vulnerability. The web search results indicate that command injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. One notable example is the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), which allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating environment variables.

Given the context of the analysis, the traffic is directed to "localhost" with HTTP requests, and the payload suggests a command injection attempt. This aligns with the characteristics of a web application vulnerability.

To proceed, I will now assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. This will involve analyzing the network traffic for any signs of successful command execution or system compromise. 

I will use the tshark_expert to look for any signs of command execution or system responses that indicate a successful attack.
Step 16: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying signs of successful command execution or system compromise through HTTP POST requests. A single HTTP POST request was identified with a URI suggesting a directory traversal attack, attempting to access the `/bin/sh` shell. The file data associated with this request was in hexadecimal format, which was decoded to ASCII to reveal the command being executed. The decoded command was `echo;echo`, which indicates an attempt to execute a command on the server. This suggests a potential command injection attack, but the command itself (`echo;echo`) does not perform any harmful action. However, the presence of such an attempt indicates a vulnerability that could be exploited for more harmful purposes.

Step 18: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed HTTP traffic directed to 'localhost' with multiple GET requests and a single POST request containing form data with the content type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
