[Task 3]
Step 1: Based on the provided summary of the PCAP file, it appears that there is consistent communication between two IP addresses (172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2) over port 80. This port is typically associated with HTTP traffic, which suggests that the service involved might be a web server or web application. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to identify any specific application or service names.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts. No additional HTTP headers like `Referer` or `Accept` were present in the requests.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase

Command output: 400	Bad Request

Step 3: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts.

To proceed, I need to identify the relevant CVE associated with directory traversal attacks on web servers or applications. I will perform a web search to find the latest information on CVEs related to directory traversal attacks.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'CVE directory traversal attack web server'
Information 1: as Directory Traversal (CWE-35), is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files present on the server hosting a web application. In some cases, this vulnerability can even allow an attacker to write files or modify their paths, altering the behavior of the web application or, in the worst-case scenario, completely compromising the server. How does it work? Letâ€™s imagine having a web application that allows users to search for images and display them on a page. After performing a search,

Information 4: nerabilities. Let's dive deeper into this critical topic to understand how attackers manipulate web servers to access unauthorized files.Directory Traversal AttacksDirectory traversal attacks, also known as path traversal attacks, are one of the most common vulnerabilities in web applications. These attacks target web servers to gain unauthorized access to files and directories outside of the web application's root directory. Through maliciously crafted requests, attackers can exploit poorly implemented inp

Step 7: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts.

I have identified that directory traversal attacks are a common vulnerability in web applications, often associated with CVEs. However, I need to determine if the specific web server or application involved in this case is vulnerable to such attacks and if the attack was successful.

To proceed, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract more detailed information about the HTTP requests and responses, focusing on any specific application or service names that might be present in the headers or payloads. This will help confirm the service involved and assess its vulnerability.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify any specific application or service names. Initially, the HTTP host and user agent fields were extracted, revealing only 'localhost' for the host and no user agent information. This suggested that the HTTP requests were made to a local server, with no specific application or service names in the user agent field. Attempts to extract additional headers like 'http.server' and 'http.x_powered_by' were unsuccessful due to invalid field names. Despite efforts to find correct field names in the manuals, no relevant information was found. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the PCAP file does not contain identifiable application or service names in the HTTP headers.

The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts.

Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the HTTP traffic in the provided PCAP file revealed attempts to access sensitive files and directories on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. These requests are indicative of directory traversal attacks, where the attacker tries to access files outside the web server's root directory. The HTTP requests and responses did not reveal any specific application or service names in the headers or payloads. Attempts to extract additional HTTP headers for application or service names were unsuccessful due to invalid field names.

Step 12: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts. The HTTP requests and responses did not reveal any specific application or service names in the headers or payloads. Attempts to extract additional HTTP headers for application or service names were unsuccessful due to invalid field names. The server was identified as a web server, likely vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, but the attack was not successful due to the server's security measures.
