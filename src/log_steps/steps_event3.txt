[Task 3]
Step 1: The summary of the TCP conversations indicates that there is traffic between two IP addresses, 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2, on port 80. This suggests HTTP traffic, which is commonly associated with web services. However, to confirm the specific service or application involved, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file. This will help identify the service or application by analyzing the HTTP headers and any specific application data.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved.

High level description of the analysis objective: Extract HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.user_agent -e http.request.uri
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The executed command successfully extracted HTTP requests and their headers, revealing attempts to access sensitive files on the server. The requests indicate a directory traversal attack targeting the 'localhost' server, with URIs suggesting exploitation of file path handling vulnerabilities.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent

Command output: localhost	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd

localhost	/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh	

Step 3: The extracted HTTP requests and headers indicate a directory traversal attack targeting the 'localhost' server. The URIs suggest exploitation of file path handling vulnerabilities, which is a common pattern associated with certain CVEs. To proceed, I need to identify the specific CVE related to this type of attack. I will perform a web search to find the relevant CVE associated with directory traversal attacks on web servers. 

Let's perform a web search to identify the CVE related to directory traversal attacks on web servers.

Directory traversal, also known as ‚Äúpath traversal‚Äù (and identified with CWE-22), is a web application vulnerability that enables attackers to access unintended files on an underlying filesystem. Depending on how and where the traversal occurs, this could enable an attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the web server, possibly enabling the attacker to read sensitive data or files, modify application data, or take full control of the web server. Traversal vulnerabilities are typically desc
Step 5: The web search results indicate that directory traversal attacks, also known as path traversal attacks, are a common vulnerability in web applications. These attacks exploit poorly implemented input validation to access files and directories outside the web application's root directory. The search results also mention several CVEs related to directory traversal vulnerabilities, but none specifically match the pattern observed in the PCAP file.

To proceed, I need to identify the specific CVE related to the directory traversal attack observed in the PCAP file. I will perform another web search with a more specific query to find the relevant CVE associated with directory traversal attacks on web servers, particularly focusing on the patterns observed in the HTTP requests.

Let's perform a web search with a more specific query to identify the CVE related to the directory traversal attack observed in the PCAP file.

Step 9: The web search results have confirmed that the directory traversal attack observed in the PCAP file is associated with CVE-2021-41773. This CVE involves the use of the ".%2e/" pattern to access files outside the web application's root directory, which matches the pattern observed in the HTTP requests extracted from the PCAP file.

Now, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE and assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack. I will analyze the PCAP file further to look for signs of successful exploitation, such as unauthorized file access or command execution.

Let's proceed with analyzing the PCAP file for evidence of successful exploitation related to CVE-2021-41773.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to analyze the PCAP file for signs of successful exploitation related to CVE-2021-41773, specifically looking for unauthorized file access or command execution patterns. CVE-2021-41773 is a path traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. The initial approach was to search for HTTP requests containing the path traversal pattern '../'. The command was corrected multiple times to properly escape the path traversal pattern, but ultimately, no output was found for the given command, indicating that there were no HTTP requests in the PCAP file that matched the path traversal pattern.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "http.request.uri contains \"..\\\\\"" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e http.request.uri

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 11: The previous analysis steps have confirmed that the directory traversal attack observed in the PCAP file is associated with CVE-2021-41773, which is a path traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. The HTTP requests extracted from the PCAP file show attempts to access sensitive files using the ".%2e/" pattern, which matches the pattern associated with this CVE.

The next step is to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE and assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack. Since the previous attempt to find signs of successful exploitation using a specific tshark command did not yield results, I will need to analyze the PCAP file further for any signs of unauthorized file access or command execution.

Let's proceed with analyzing the PCAP file for evidence of successful exploitation related to CVE-2021-41773. I will use the tshark_expert to look for any signs of unauthorized file access or command execution patterns.
Step 12: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying signs of unauthorized file access or command execution patterns related to CVE-2021-41773. Initial findings showed multiple HTTP requests with a status code of 400, indicating attempts to access sensitive files using directory traversal techniques. However, further investigation for successful HTTP responses (status code 200) revealed no output, suggesting that these attempts were unsuccessful.
Executed command: -Y "http.response.code == 200" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.request.uri

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 13: 
Step 14: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify unauthorized file access or command execution patterns related to CVE-2021-41773 by examining HTTP traffic for successful access attempts and path traversal attempts. Initially, a command was executed to filter HTTP responses with status code 200, but it yielded no results, indicating no successful access attempts were recorded in the PCAP file. Subsequently, an attempt was made to filter HTTP requests with URIs indicating path traversal attempts using '../'. However, the command failed due to incorrect syntax, as '../' was too long to be a valid character constant. Despite searching the manual for a correct syntax, the issue remained unresolved, and no further exploration of the PCAP was allowed.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri contains '../'" -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e http.request.uri

Command output: Error: '../' is too long to be a valid character constant. The filter syntax was incorrect for detecting path traversal attempts.

Step 15: 
Step 16: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify signs of unauthorized file access or command execution patterns related to CVE-2021-41773 by examining HTTP traffic for successful access attempts and path traversal patterns. Initial attempts to find HTTP responses with status codes in the 2xx range yielded no results, suggesting no successful HTTP responses in the PCAP file. Further investigation into potential path traversal patterns in HTTP requests also resulted in an error due to incorrect filter syntax. The error was related to the interpretation of the '../' string as a character constant, and the correct syntax for filtering such patterns was not determined within the constraints of the analysis.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri contains '../'" -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e http.request.uri

Command output: Error: Command '['tshark', '-r', 'C:\Users\Stefano\OneDrive\Desktop\LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic\src\data\raw\eventID_3\CVE-2021-42013.pcap', '-Y', "http.request.uri contains '../'", '-T', 'fields', '-e', 'ip.src', '-e', 'ip.dst', '-e', 'http.request.uri']' returned non-zero exit status 4.
tshark: '../' is too long to be a valid character constant.
    http.request.uri contains '../'

Step 18: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying unauthorized file access or command execution patterns related to CVE-2021-41773. Initial findings showed HTTP requests with a 400 status code attempting to access sensitive files, indicating malformed or unauthorized requests. Further investigation for successful accesses with a 200 status code returned no results, suggesting no successful unauthorized access was detected in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "http.response.code == 200" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.request.uri

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 19: 
Step 20: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed attempts to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41773. This vulnerability affects the Apache HTTP Server, specifically version 2.4.49. The HTTP requests extracted from the PCAP file showed attempts to access sensitive files using the ".%2e/" pattern, which is indicative of a path traversal attack. However, further analysis of the PCAP file for signs of successful exploitation, such as unauthorized file access or command execution, yielded no results. The HTTP responses did not contain any successful status codes (e.g., 200), indicating that the attack attempts were unsuccessful. Therefore, while the service was targeted by the attack, there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was successful or that the service was vulnerable to this specific attack.
