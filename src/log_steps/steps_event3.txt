[Task 3]
Step 1: Report of the log analysis done by the log reporter:

1. **Summary of Relevant and Suspicious Events:**
   - The log entries indicate multiple attempts to access sensitive files and directories using directory traversal techniques. The requests are encoded to bypass potential security filters, as seen in the use of `%2e` (URL encoding for ".") to attempt directory traversal.
   - The files targeted include critical system files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/auth.log`, which are commonly targeted for unauthorized access to system credentials and logs.
   - There is also an attempt to execute a shell command via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, suggesting an attempt to exploit a command injection vulnerability.

2. **Service Involved:**
   - The log format and the nature of the requests suggest that the service involved is likely an Apache HTTP Server. The presence of `/cgi-bin/` in the request path is indicative of a CGI script execution attempt, which is commonly associated with Apache configurations.

3. **Detection of Known Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Patterns:**
   - The directory traversal attempts are indicative of attempts to exploit vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized file access. This pattern is often associated with CVE-2019-0211 and similar vulnerabilities in web servers that improperly handle URL-encoded paths.
   - The POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` is a classic example of an attempt to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability, potentially related to CVE-2019-0211 or similar issues where CGI scripts are improperly secured.

4. **Excerpts from the Log:**
   - "GET /icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 400 226
   - "POST /cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh HTTP/1.1" 400 226

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The log entries reveal a series of suspicious activities aimed at exploiting potential vulnerabilities in the web server, specifically through directory traversal and command injection techniques. These activities warrant further investigation, particularly in correlation with network traffic captures, to determine the extent of the attempted exploitation and any potential breaches.
Step 2: The log analysis suggests that the service involved is likely an Apache HTTP Server, and there are attempts to exploit vulnerabilities through directory traversal and command injection techniques. The network traffic summary shows multiple TCP conversations between two IP addresses on port 80, which is typically used for HTTP traffic. 

To further investigate, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to confirm the presence of Apache HTTP Server and identify any suspicious activities or patterns that align with the log analysis.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file.
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a potential directory traversal attack, with multiple GET requests attempting to access sensitive files on the server. Additionally, a POST request was made to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` with the data `echo;echo`, indicating an attempt to execute shell commands on the server. This suggests an exploitation attempt to gain unauthorized access or execute commands on the server.

Command output: 6563686f3b6563686f


Step 4: The analysis of the PCAP file and the log entries suggest that there is an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server through directory traversal and command injection techniques. The network traffic summary shows multiple TCP conversations on port 80, which is typically used for HTTP traffic. The presence of a POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` with the data `echo;echo` indicates an attempt to execute shell commands on the server.

To further confirm the presence of Apache HTTP Server and identify any suspicious activities or patterns that align with the log analysis, I will proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file. This will help in verifying the service involved and gathering more evidence of the malicious activities.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file.
Step 5: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple HTTP requests attempting to access sensitive files and directories on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/auth.log`. These requests are indicative of a directory traversal attack. Additionally, there was a POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, suggesting an attempt to execute a shell command on the server, potentially indicating a remote code execution attempt. The HTTP response headers confirm that the server is running Apache/2.4.50 (Unix), which is known to have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The presence of these attack attempts suggests that the server might be vulnerable to such attacks.

The joke was on roughly 2 million servers on Monday (April 1!), as the Apache Foundation released a patch for a privilege escalation bug (CVE-2019-0211) in Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17–2.4.38. Unfortunately, this is no laughing matter, since this vulnerability makes it possible for module code—software components that enhance the functionality of Apache HTTPD se
Information 5: rk. What is CVE-2019-0211? In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, code executed in less-privileged child processes or threads could run arbitrary code with the parent process's privileges by manipulating the scoreboard. The Impact of CVE-2019-0211 Affected Versions: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.38 Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation Systems Not Affected: Non-Unix systems Technical Details of CVE-2019-0211 This section provides more in-depth technical insights into the vulnerability. V
Step 8: 
Step 9: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file and the log entries revealed multiple attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server through directory traversal and command injection techniques. The network traffic summary showed multiple TCP conversations on port 80, which is typically used for HTTP traffic. The presence of a POST request to `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh` with the data `echo;echo` indicates an attempt to execute shell commands on the server. The HTTP response headers confirmed that the server is running Apache/2.4.50 (Unix), which is known to have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The presence of these attack attempts suggests that the server might be vulnerable to such attacks. However, the HTTP responses indicate a 400 Bad Request, suggesting that the attack was not successful.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2019-0211
Affected Service: Apache HTTP Server
Is Service Vulnerable: True
