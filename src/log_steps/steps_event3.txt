[Task 3]
Step 1: The summary of the TCP conversations indicates that there is traffic between two IP addresses, 172.18.0.1 and 172.18.0.2, on port 80. This suggests HTTP traffic, which is commonly associated with web services. However, to confirm the specific service or application involved, I need to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file. This will help identify the service or application by examining the HTTP headers and any potential application-specific data.

Let's proceed with extracting HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to identify the service or application involved.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file.

```json
{
  "task": "Extract HTTP requests and their headers to identify the service or application involved.",
  "suggested_tshark_command": "tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y 'http.request' -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent"
}
```
Step 2: 
Step 3: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicating a potential directory traversal attack. Additionally, a POST request to a CGI script suggests an attempt to execute shell commands on the server, pointing to a possible remote code execution attack. The attacker used path traversal techniques to access files like /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and others.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri -e http.user_agent

Command output: localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/shadow	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/hosts

localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.bash_history	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/authorized_keys	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/var/log/syslog	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/var/log/auth.log	
localhost	GET	/icons/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/var/www/html/config.php	
localhost	POST	/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh	

Step 4: The analysis of the HTTP requests extracted from the PCAP file indicates a potential directory traversal attack and a possible remote code execution attempt. The attacker used path traversal techniques to access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others, and attempted to execute shell commands via a POST request to a CGI script.

To proceed, I need to identify the relevant CVE associated with these types of attacks. This will involve searching for known vulnerabilities related to directory traversal and remote code execution in web services, particularly those that might be exploited through HTTP requests.

Next, I will perform a web search to identify the CVE associated with these attack patterns.
Step 5: Search result for query: 'CVE directory traversal remote code execution HTTP'
Information 1: xecution and Path Traversal attack POC: An attacker can use specially crafted requests beginning with (../) and modified requests containing malicious code to perform directory traversal and remote code execution. $ curl 'http://localhost:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:text/plain; echo; whoami'Apache 2.4.49 httpd.conf vulnerable configurations: 1. 1.

Remote Code Execution While CVE-2021-41773 was initially documented as Path traversal and File disclosure vulnerability additional research concluded that the vulnerability can be further exploited to conduct remote code execution when mod_cgi module is enabled on the Apache HTTP server, this allows an attacker to leverage the path traversal vulnerability and call any binary on the system using HT

Information 5: ath traversal, also known as directory traversal, allows an attacker to access files and directories that they should not be able to access on a web server. When an attacker wants to navigate through one or more directory levels in the current directory, he or she frequently enters characters such as "..", "../", or "../../". When user input in web applications allows a user to construct file paths without proper input validation, a vulnerability occurs. Remote Code Execution: An attacker can use the Remote

Step 8: The web search results indicate that the attack patterns observed in the PCAP file, specifically the directory traversal and remote code execution attempts, are associated with CVE-2021-41773. This CVE affects the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, allowing path traversal and remote code execution when the mod_cgi module is enabled.

Now, I need to assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. To do this, I will analyze the PCAP file for any signs of successful exploitation, such as responses indicating unauthorized access or command execution.

Let's proceed with analyzing the PCAP file for evidence of successful exploitation. I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract relevant response data from the PCAP file.
Step 9: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP responses to identify signs of successful exploitation, such as unauthorized access or command execution. The investigation revealed only HTTP response codes of 400, indicating 'Bad Request.' This suggests that the requests were malformed or not understood by the server, and no signs of successful exploitation were found in the HTTP responses.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.response.code

Step 11: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicating a potential directory traversal attack. Additionally, a POST request to a CGI script suggests an attempt to execute shell commands on the server, pointing to a possible remote code execution attack. The attacker used path traversal techniques to access files like /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and others. The web search results indicate that these attack patterns are associated with CVE-2021-41773, which affects the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, allowing path traversal and remote code execution when the mod_cgi module is enabled. However, the analysis of HTTP responses revealed only HTTP response codes of 400, indicating 'Bad Request,' suggesting that the requests were malformed or not understood by the server, and no signs of successful exploitation were found.
