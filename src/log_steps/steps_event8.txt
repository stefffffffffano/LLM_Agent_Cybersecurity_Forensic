[Task 8]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates multiple TCP conversations between two IP addresses, primarily on port 3306 and port 80. Port 3306 is typically associated with MySQL databases, while port 80 is associated with HTTP traffic. To identify the service or application involved, I need to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic on port 3306 and HTTP traffic on port 80.

Next, I will extract the application layer data for both MySQL and HTTP traffic to confirm the services involved. This will help in identifying the service or application involved in the traffic. 

Let's start by extracting the MySQL traffic details from the PCAP file.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis confirmed MySQL traffic on port 3306 by extracting MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file. The output included various MySQL queries such as SELECT, SET, and SHOW commands, which are typical of MySQL operations. This confirms that the traffic on port 3306 is indeed MySQL traffic.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.srcport -e tcp.dstport -e mysql.query

Step 3: The analysis of the MySQL traffic on port 3306 has confirmed the presence of MySQL operations, including various queries such as SELECT, SET, and SHOW commands. This confirms that the traffic on port 3306 is indeed MySQL traffic. Now, I need to analyze the HTTP traffic on port 80 to confirm the presence of HTTP services and identify any potential malicious activities.

Next, I will extract the HTTP requests and their headers from the PCAP file to confirm the HTTP service and look for any signs of malicious activities.
Step 4: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers, revealing several GET and POST requests to 'localhost:8080' with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. The URIs included paths like '//index.php', '//import.php', and a potentially suspicious one with a query string that includes '../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43', indicating an attempt to access sensitive files or directories. Additional HTTP headers, such as 'Referer' and 'Cookie', were extracted, showing session identifiers and other encoded information. The 'Referer' field was empty, suggesting direct access to the URLs. HTTP response codes were also extracted, showing a mix of '200 OK' and '302 Found' responses. Attempts to extract HTTP response content were made, but the output was too long, even when filtering for specific content types like 'text/html'. This analysis suggests potential malicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts and data leakage, but further investigation is needed to confirm these findings.
Executed command: -Y "http.response && http.content_type contains \"text/html\"" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase -e http.file_data

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.

Step 5: The analysis of the HTTP traffic on port 80 has revealed several GET and POST requests to 'localhost:8080' with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. The URIs included paths like '//index.php', '//import.php', and a potentially suspicious one with a query string that includes '../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43', indicating an attempt to access sensitive files or directories. This suggests potential malicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts and data leakage.

Now, I need to identify the relevant CVE based on the captured data. The presence of a suspicious query string in the HTTP requests suggests a potential directory traversal attack. I will perform a web search to find any CVEs related to directory traversal vulnerabilities in MySQL or related services.

Next, I will perform a web search to identify any CVEs related to directory traversal vulnerabilities in MySQL or related services.

Step 7: The web search results indicate that there is a known directory traversal vulnerability in MySQL, identified as CVE-2010-1848. This vulnerability allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended table grants to read field definitions of arbitrary tables, and on certain versions, to read or delete content of arbitrary tables via a directory traversal attack. The suspicious query string in the HTTP requests suggests a potential directory traversal attack, which aligns with the characteristics of CVE-2010-1848.

Next, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE from the captured data. Specifically, I will look for signs of unauthorized access attempts or data leakage that could be indicative of exploitation of this vulnerability. 

I will use the tshark_expert to extract any signs of remote code execution attempts or unauthorized data access in the MySQL traffic.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying signs of remote code execution attempts or unauthorized data access in MySQL traffic, specifically looking for unusual queries or commands that could indicate exploitation of CVE-2010-1848. The CVE is related to a vulnerability in MySQL that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COM_FIELD_LIST request. The initial attempt to filter for MySQL COM_FIELD_LIST requests using the display filter `mysql.command == 0x04` returned no output. Despite multiple attempts to verify the correct filter syntax for MySQL commands related to COM_FIELD_LIST through the tshark manual, no relevant information was found. Therefore, the final result is that no signs of remote code execution attempts or unauthorized data access were detected in the MySQL traffic based on the available filters and information.
Executed command: -Y "mysql.command == 0x04" -T fields -e frame.number -e mysql.query

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 9: The analysis of the MySQL traffic did not reveal any signs of remote code execution attempts or unauthorized data access related to CVE-2010-1848. However, the HTTP traffic analysis showed potential directory traversal attempts, which align with the characteristics of this CVE. To further assess whether the service is vulnerable and if the attack was successful, I need to evaluate the MySQL version used in the traffic and check if it falls within the vulnerable versions for CVE-2010-1848.

Next, I will extract the MySQL version information from the captured data to determine if the service is vulnerable to CVE-2010-1848.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The MySQL version extracted from the PCAP file is 5.5.62. This version is not vulnerable to CVE-2010-1848, as the vulnerability affects versions prior to 5.1.47.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -T fields -e mysql.version

Command output: 5.5.62

Step 13: 
Step 14: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed MySQL traffic on port 3306 and HTTP traffic on port 80. The MySQL traffic included various queries typical of MySQL operations, confirming the presence of MySQL service. The HTTP traffic analysis showed several GET and POST requests with a user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0', including a suspicious query string indicating a potential directory traversal attack. A web search identified CVE-2010-1848 as a relevant directory traversal vulnerability in MySQL. However, the MySQL version extracted from the PCAP file is 5.5.62, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2010-1848. No signs of remote code execution attempts or unauthorized data access were detected in the MySQL traffic. Therefore, the service is not vulnerable to the identified CVE, and the attack was not successful.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2010-1848
Affected Service: MySQL
Is Service Vulnerable: False
Attack succeeded: False
