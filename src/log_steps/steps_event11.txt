[Task 11]
Step 1: Based on the provided summary of the PCAP file, it appears that there is significant traffic involving the IP address 172.18.0.3 on port 6379. This port is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, to confirm the presence of the Redis service and identify any specific commands or interactions, I need to analyze the packet contents for Redis protocol-specific data.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract and analyze the Redis protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service and gather more information about the interactions.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract Redis protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service and gather more information about the interactions.
Step 2: Network error while processing
Step 3: The previous attempt to extract Redis protocol data using the "tshark_expert" encountered a network error. To proceed, I will attempt to extract the Redis protocol data again to confirm the service and gather more information about the interactions.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract Redis protocol data from the PCAP file to confirm the service and gather more information about the interactions.
Step 4: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract Redis protocol-specific data to confirm the presence of the Redis service and analyze interactions. Initially, I attempted to extract Redis-specific fields using tshark, but it turned out that tshark does not have built-in support for parsing Redis protocol commands and responses directly. Therefore, I focused on extracting the raw data from the packets that are likely to contain Redis commands and responses by attempting to extract the payload data from the TCP segments on port 6379. However, the manual search did not yield specific Redis fields, and the command to extract Redis protocol details resulted in an error, indicating that the fields 'redis.command' and 'redis.response' are not valid fields in tshark. This suggests that tshark does not support Redis protocol parsing directly. As a result, I was unable to extract Redis protocol-specific data using tshark.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e redis.command -e redis.response -c 20

Command output: The error indicates that the fields `redis.command` and `redis.response` are not valid fields in tshark. This suggests that tshark does not have built-in support for parsing Redis protocol commands and responses directly.

Step 5: The previous attempts to extract Redis protocol data using tshark were unsuccessful due to the lack of built-in support for parsing Redis protocol commands and responses directly. Since tshark cannot directly parse Redis protocol, I need to explore other methods to confirm the presence of the Redis service and gather more information about the interactions.

Next, I will perform a web search to find any known CVEs associated with Redis that might match the observed traffic patterns. This will help in identifying potential vulnerabilities and attacks related to Redis. 

Action: Perform a web search to find known CVEs associated with Redis.
Step 6: 
Step 7: Search result for query: 'known CVEs associated with Redis'

Information 4: Two critical vulnerabilities have been identified in Redis, the widely used in-memory database, potentially exposing millions of systems to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and remote code execution (RCE). These flaws tracked as CVE-2024-51741 and CVE-2024-46981, highlight significant security risks for Redis users and underscore the importance of timely updates and mitigations.

Step 8: Based on the web search results, I have identified several CVEs associated with Redis, including CVE-2022-31144, CVE-2025-21605, CVE-2024-51741, and CVE-2024-46981. These vulnerabilities pose significant security risks, including remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks. 

To proceed, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with these identified CVEs from the PCAP file. This will involve analyzing the network traffic for patterns or behaviors indicative of these vulnerabilities being exploited.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to analyze the PCAP file for signs of remote code execution attempts or denial-of-service attacks, which are common impacts of the identified CVEs. This will help in gathering evidence of malicious activities.
Step 9: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to analyze the PCAP file for signs of remote code execution attempts or denial-of-service attacks related to Redis CVEs. The initial approach was to filter Redis traffic on port 6379 and look for specific Redis commands that might indicate exploitation attempts. However, the command to filter for specific Redis commands using the 'tcp.payload contains' filter failed because the 'contains' operator expects a byte sequence rather than a string. The manual search revealed that the correct approach would be to convert the command strings into their hexadecimal byte representation. Unfortunately, due to the constraints, I was unable to execute the corrected command. Therefore, the analysis could not be completed as intended.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (tcp.payload contains 'EVAL' || tcp.payload contains 'CONFIG' || tcp.payload contains 'SLAVEOF' || tcp.payload contains 'FLUSHALL')" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.payload

Command output: The command failed because the 'tcp.payload contains' filter was not correctly handling the string literals for the Redis commands. The 'contains' operator expects a byte sequence rather than a string.

Step 10: 
Step 11: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial suggested command was missing the 'tshark' command and the '-r' option to specify the PCAP file. Additionally, the 'tcp.payload' field was not directly filterable in the suggested manner. After reviewing the manual, I refined the command to include the correct syntax for filtering TCP payloads for specific strings related to Redis commands. The refined command was executed to detect the presence of Redis commands like 'EVAL', 'CONFIG', 'SLAVEOF', and 'FLUSHALL', which are indicative of potential exploitation attempts. However, the command execution returned no output, indicating that there were no such patterns or behaviors detected in the PCAP file.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (frame contains 'EVAL' || frame contains 'CONFIG' || frame contains 'SLAVEOF' || frame contains 'FLUSHALL')" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.payload

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 12: The previous attempts to detect signs of exploitation related to Redis CVEs in the PCAP file did not yield any results. The command executed to search for specific Redis commands indicative of exploitation attempts returned no output, suggesting that there were no such patterns or behaviors detected in the PCAP file.

To proceed, I will store this information in memory for future reference and then evaluate whether the service is vulnerable and if the attack was successful based on the current findings.
