[Task 19]
Step 1: The summary of the TCP conversations indicates a significant amount of traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.4 and 172.18.0.2 on port 6379. This port is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, to confirm the presence of Redis or any other service on this port, I need to analyze the packet contents to identify any service-specific signatures or commands.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 to confirm the service or application involved.

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 to confirm the service or application involved.
Step 2: TsharkExpert analysis did not complete successfully.
Step 3: Since the previous attempt to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 using the "tshark_expert" was unsuccessful, I will attempt to run the analysis again. 

Action: Use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 to confirm the service or application involved.
Step 4: Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract application layer data from traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with Redis. Initially, I attempted to extract the data using a general command to display the frame number, source IP, destination IP, and application layer data. However, the output was too long, so I refined the command to limit the output to the first 20 packets. Despite this, the command did not display any application layer data, likely due to the absence of the 'data' field in the packets or the need for a more specific field related to the Redis protocol. After searching the tshark manual, I could not find Redis-specific fields or options to extract the application layer data more effectively. Therefore, the final result is that no application layer data was found for the given command.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e data -c 20

Command output: 1	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
2	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
3	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
4	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
5	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
6	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
7	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
8	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
9	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
10	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
11	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
12	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
13	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
14	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
15	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
16	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
17	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	
18	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
19	172.18.0.4	172.18.0.2	
20	172.18.0.2	172.18.0.4	

Step 5: The previous attempts to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 using the "tshark_expert" were unsuccessful. The command used did not display any application layer data, likely due to the absence of the 'data' field in the packets or the need for a more specific field related to the Redis protocol. Since the service on port 6379 is suspected to be Redis, I need to confirm this by identifying Redis-specific commands or signatures in the traffic.

Next, I will perform a web search to find Redis-specific fields or options that can be used with tshark to extract application layer data more effectively. This will help in confirming the presence of the Redis service on port 6379. 

Action: Perform a web search to find Redis-specific fields or options for tshark to extract application layer data.

Step 7: Search result for query: 'tshark Redis-specific fields or options'

Step 20: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.4 and 172.18.0.2 on port 6379, which is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, attempts to extract application layer data to confirm the presence of Redis were unsuccessful. The command used did not display any application layer data, likely due to the absence of the 'data' field in the packets or the need for a more specific field related to the Redis protocol. Despite multiple attempts to find Redis-specific fields or options for tshark, no conclusive evidence was found to confirm the presence of Redis or any other service on port 6379. As a result, the analysis could not proceed to identify any CVEs or assess vulnerabilities and attack success.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: N/A
Affected Service: N/A
Is Service Vulnerable: False
Attack succeeded: False
