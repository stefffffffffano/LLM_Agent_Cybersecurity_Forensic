[Task 19]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates a significant amount of traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.4 and 172.18.0.2 on port 6379. This port is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, to confirm the presence of Redis or any other service on this port, I need to analyze the packet contents to identify any service-specific signatures or commands.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 to confirm the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract application layer data from traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with Redis. Initial attempts to use the `-e data` field did not yield results, and searches for Redis-specific fields in the tshark manual were unsuccessful. A general approach to display all fields for traffic on port 6379 resulted in an output that was too long. Without specific Redis fields identified, the analysis could not proceed further to extract application layer data for Redis traffic.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.

Step 3: The previous attempt to extract application layer data from traffic on port 6379 using a general approach resulted in an output that was too long. To proceed, I need to refine the analysis to focus on specific patterns or commands that are characteristic of Redis traffic. This will help confirm the presence of the Redis service.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract specific Redis protocol commands or patterns from the traffic on port 6379.
Step 4: Final report from the forensic expert:
Despite multiple attempts to extract Redis protocol commands using various fields and methods, including `redis.command`, `data.text`, and `data`, no output was found. The final attempt to extract raw data using the `-x` option resulted in an output that was too long, and further refinement using `-e data.text` still yielded no results. This suggests that the expected Redis protocol commands or patterns are not present in the PCAP file in a recognizable format or that the fields used were not appropriate for capturing the data. Therefore, no Redis protocol commands could be confirmed from the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 5: The previous attempts to confirm the presence of the Redis service on port 6379 by extracting specific Redis protocol commands or patterns were unsuccessful. This suggests that the expected Redis protocol commands or patterns are not present in the PCAP file in a recognizable format, or the fields used were not appropriate for capturing the data. 

To proceed, I will now focus on identifying any other potential services or applications that might be using port 6379, as the initial assumption of Redis could not be confirmed. I will analyze the traffic for any other recognizable patterns or signatures that could indicate a different service or application.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract any identifiable application layer data or patterns from the traffic on port 6379 that could indicate the presence of a different service or application.
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract identifiable application layer data or patterns from traffic on port 6379 to determine if a different service or application is present. Initial attempts to extract data using the 'data' field yielded no output, likely due to incorrect field usage. Subsequent attempts using 'tcp.payload' resulted in excessive output, indicating the presence of data but without specific patterns or keywords to filter non-standard Redis traffic. Manual searches for relevant filters or fields to identify non-standard Redis traffic did not provide useful information. Therefore, the analysis could not conclusively identify a different service or application on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e tcp.payload

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.

Step 7: The previous attempts to identify the service on port 6379 were inconclusive, as the expected Redis protocol commands or patterns were not found. Since the initial assumption of Redis could not be confirmed, and no other service or application was identified, I will now proceed to search for any known vulnerabilities or CVEs associated with traffic on port 6379. This might provide insights into potential vulnerabilities or attacks that could be relevant to the captured data.

Next, I will perform a web search to find any CVEs associated with services or applications that might use port 6379.

Step 9: Based on the web search results, it appears that port 6379 is commonly associated with the Redis service, and there are known vulnerabilities related to Redis. However, the previous analysis could not confirm the presence of Redis or any other service on this port. Given the information about potential vulnerabilities, I will now focus on gathering evidence of malicious activities associated with Redis-related CVEs.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to search for any signs of exploitation attempts or unusual activities in the traffic on port 6379 that could be linked to known Redis vulnerabilities.
Step 10: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the traffic on port 6379 using the command to count TCP streams over time has shown a fluctuating number of connections, with some intervals showing a significantly higher number of connections than others. This could indicate unusual activity or potential exploitation attempts, as a high number of connections in a short period might suggest automated or scripted actions. However, no specific Redis commands associated with exploitation attempts were found in the traffic.
Executed command: -q -z io,stat,1,"COUNT(tcp.stream)tcp.stream" -Y "tcp.port == 6379"

======================================


Step 11: Based on the previous analysis, there is a significant amount of traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, the presence of Redis could not be confirmed through the analysis of the PCAP file. The web search indicated that there are known vulnerabilities related to Redis, but without confirmation of Redis traffic, it's challenging to directly link these vulnerabilities to the captured data.

The analysis of TCP streams over time showed fluctuating connections, which might suggest unusual activity or potential exploitation attempts. However, no specific Redis commands associated with exploitation attempts were found.

To proceed, I will now focus on evaluating whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and whether the attack was successful. This will involve assessing the nature of the traffic and any potential signs of successful exploitation.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to analyze the traffic for any signs of successful exploitation or vulnerability exploitation attempts on port 6379.
Step 12: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying potential exploitation attempts on Redis by filtering for specific commands known to be associated with such attempts, like "CONFIG", "SLAVEOF", or "FLUSHALL". However, due to limitations in filtering based on specific data content within packets, no relevant information was found in the manual to construct a precise filter. As a result, the analysis could not conclusively identify any signs of successful exploitation or vulnerability exploitation attempts on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.flags -e data.text

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.

Step 21: Based on the previous analysis, there is a significant amount of traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with the Redis service. However, the presence of Redis could not be confirmed through the analysis of the PCAP file. The web search indicated that there are known vulnerabilities related to Redis, but without confirmation of Redis traffic, it's challenging to directly link these vulnerabilities to the captured data.

The analysis of TCP streams over time showed fluctuating connections, which might suggest unusual activity or potential exploitation attempts. However, no specific Redis commands associated with exploitation attempts were found.

To proceed, I will now focus on evaluating whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and whether the attack was successful. This will involve assessing the nature of the traffic and any potential signs of successful exploitation.

Next, I will perform a web search to find any CVEs associated with services or applications that might use port 6379.

Step 23: 
Step 24: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with the Redis service. Despite multiple attempts, the presence of Redis could not be confirmed through the analysis of the PCAP file. However, web searches indicated that there are known vulnerabilities related to Redis, such as CVE-2024-31989. The analysis of TCP streams over time showed fluctuating connections, which might suggest unusual activity or potential exploitation attempts. However, no specific Redis commands associated with exploitation attempts were found. Without confirmation of Redis traffic, it's challenging to directly link these vulnerabilities to the captured data. Therefore, the service or application on port 6379 could not be confirmed as vulnerable, and no evidence of a successful attack was found.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2024-31989
Affected Service: Redis
Is Service Vulnerable: False
Attack succeeded: False
