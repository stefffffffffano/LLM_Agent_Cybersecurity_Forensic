[Task 19]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates a significant amount of traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.4 and 172.18.0.2 on port 6379. Port 6379 is commonly associated with Redis, an in-memory data structure store. This suggests that the service involved might be Redis. However, to confirm this, I need to analyze the traffic more closely to identify any specific Redis commands or patterns that would confirm the presence of Redis.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to extract application layer data from the traffic on port 6379 to confirm the presence of Redis commands.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract application layer data using the '-e data' field did not yield any output, indicating that the field used might not be appropriate for extracting Redis-specific data. Despite searching the tshark manual for a more suitable field or method, no alternative was found. Therefore, the command executed did not produce any results, and no Redis commands or patterns could be identified from the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 3: The initial attempt to extract application layer data using the '-e data' field did not yield any output, indicating that the field used might not be appropriate for extracting Redis-specific data. Despite searching the tshark manual for a more suitable field or method, no alternative was found. Therefore, the command executed did not produce any results, and no Redis commands or patterns could be identified from the traffic on port 6379.

To proceed, I will perform a web search to identify any known CVEs associated with Redis that could be relevant to the traffic observed in the PCAP file. This will help in determining if there are any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in this context.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'CVE vulnerabilities associated with Redis'
Information 1: Two critical vulnerabilities have been identified in Redis, the widely used in-memory database, potentially exposing millions of systems to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and remote code execution (RCE). These flaws tracked as CVE-2024-51741 and CVE-2024-46981, highlight significant security risks for Redis users and underscore the importance of timely updates and mitigations. CVE-2024-51741: Denial Of Service via Malformed ACL Selectors The first vulnerability, CVE-2024-51741, affects Redis versions 7.0.0

Step 5: Based on the web search results, there are several known vulnerabilities associated with Redis, including CVE-2024-51741 and CVE-2024-46981, which involve denial-of-service and remote code execution risks. However, to determine if any of these vulnerabilities are relevant to the traffic observed in the PCAP file, I need to gather evidence of any malicious activities that might be associated with these CVEs.

Next, I will use the "tshark_expert" to analyze the PCAP file for any signs of remote code execution attempts or denial-of-service activities that could be linked to the identified CVEs. This will help in gathering evidence of malicious activities.
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file for traffic on port 6379 did not reveal any payload or application layer data. Multiple attempts to extract data using different tshark commands yielded no output, suggesting that the packets on this port do not contain any application layer data or the data is encoded in a way that was not captured by the commands used. Therefore, no signs of remote code execution attempts or denial-of-service activities were detected in the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.data

Command output: No output found for the given command.

Step 7: Based on the analysis so far, the traffic on port 6379 is likely associated with Redis, but no application layer data or specific Redis commands were extracted from the PCAP file. Additionally, a web search identified several known vulnerabilities associated with Redis, including CVE-2024-51741 and CVE-2024-46981, which involve denial-of-service and remote code execution risks. However, no evidence of malicious activities related to these CVEs was found in the PCAP file.

To proceed, I will store the relevant information about the identified vulnerabilities and the lack of evidence of malicious activities in the memory. This will help in keeping track of the analysis progress and findings.
