[Task 0]
Step 1: Based on the TCP conversations summary, there are two main connections: one on port 9100 and another on port 4369. These ports are often associated with specific services. Port 9100 is commonly used for printing services, while port 4369 is associated with the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd), which is used by distributed Erlang applications.

To proceed, I need to verify the service running on port 4369 to confirm if it is indeed related to Erlang or another service. This will help in identifying the application involved and any potential vulnerabilities.

Next, I will use the tshark_expert to extract more detailed information about the traffic on port 4369 to confirm the service or application involved.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to analyze the traffic on port 4369 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying the service or application involved in the traffic on port 4369. Initially, the traffic was filtered and relevant fields were extracted, but the payloads were in hexadecimal format. Attempts to decode these payloads into ASCII text did not yield meaningful information. Given that port 4369 is commonly associated with the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd), further exploration was conducted to find specific fields or options related to the epmd protocol. However, the manual search did not provide additional insights. Based on the information gathered, it is likely that the traffic is related to the Erlang distributed computing system, but no specific service or application could be conclusively identified from the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 4369" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.port -e tcp.flags -e tcp.payload

Step 3: Based on the analysis of the traffic on port 4369, it is likely related to the Erlang distributed computing system, but no specific service or application could be conclusively identified from the PCAP file. The next step is to analyze the traffic on port 9100, which is commonly associated with printing services, to identify the service or application involved. This will help in determining if there are any vulnerabilities or malicious activities associated with it.

Action: Use the tshark_expert to analyze the traffic on port 9100 to identify the service or application involved.
Step 4: 
Step 5: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying the service or application involved in the traffic on port 9100. The initial command was corrected to include the 'tshark' keyword and the '-r <pcap_file>' option. The payloads were extracted in hexadecimal format, but decoding them using '-T fields -e data.text' did not yield recognizable text. Further attempts to decode the payloads using the 'Decode As' feature were considered, but no specific protocol was identified for port 9100. The analysis did not reveal any specific service or application associated with the traffic on port 9100.
Executed command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "tcp.port == 9100" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.port -e tcp.flags -e data.text

Step 6: The analysis of the traffic on both ports 4369 and 9100 did not conclusively identify a specific service or application. Port 4369 is likely related to the Erlang distributed computing system, while port 9100 is commonly associated with printing services. However, no specific service or application was identified from the PCAP file for either port.

To proceed, I need to identify any potential vulnerabilities or CVEs associated with the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) or printing services on port 9100. This will help in determining if there are any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the observed traffic.

Next, I will perform a web search to find any relevant CVEs associated with the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) and printing services on port 9100.
Step 7: Search result for query: 'CVE Erlang Port Mapper Daemon epmd'
Information 1: Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) servers on port 4369/tcp. This daemon acts as a name server for hosts involved in distributed Erlang computations. It is included in Erlang/OTP. As described by Erlang: Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang’s runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault
Information 2:  The Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) is a built-in component that helps Erlang-based applications (including RabbitMQ) discover each other’s distribution ports for clustering. Although EPMD itself isn’t directly dangerous, its exposure on the public internet often signals that Erlang Distribution ports are also exposed. This creates a serious security risk: if attackers find these distribution ports, they can potentially join your cluster, run arbitrary code, and compromise your systems. Recent scans have

Skipped call(s): CVE printing service port 9100
Step 9: The search results indicate that the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) is a component used in Erlang-based applications for discovering distribution ports, which can pose a security risk if exposed to the public internet. However, no specific CVE was identified in the search results.

To proceed, I need to perform a web search for CVEs associated with printing services on port 9100, as this was skipped in the previous step. This will help in determining if there are any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the observed traffic.

Next, I will perform a web search to find any relevant CVEs associated with printing services on port 9100.

Step 11: Based on the search results, the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) is a component used in Erlang-based applications for discovering distribution ports, which can pose a security risk if exposed to the public internet. However, no specific CVE was identified in the search results. For the printing service on port 9100, it is associated with raw printing and can be exploited for various attacks, but no specific CVE was mentioned.

To proceed, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified CVE or vulnerabilities. Since no specific CVE was identified, I will focus on analyzing the traffic for signs of exploitation or malicious activities related to the general vulnerabilities of the services identified.

Next, I will use the tshark_expert to analyze the traffic for any signs of exploitation or malicious activities related to the general vulnerabilities of the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon and printing services on port 9100.
Step 12: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on examining traffic on ports 9100 and 4369 for signs of exploitation or malicious activities. The traffic on port 9100, likely related to a printing service, showed a series of TCP packets with various flags, including SYN, ACK, PSH, and FIN. These flags indicate normal TCP connection establishment, data transfer, and termination processes. Similarly, the traffic on port 4369, related to the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon, also displayed typical TCP flags without any unusual patterns or anomalies. No signs of exploitation or malicious activities were detected in the traffic on these ports.

Step 13: Based on the analysis, the traffic on both ports 4369 and 9100 did not reveal any specific service or application, nor did it show signs of exploitation or malicious activities. The Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) on port 4369 and the printing service on port 9100 are both associated with potential vulnerabilities, but no specific CVE was identified in the search results.

To proceed, I will summarize the findings and provide the final answer based on the analysis conducted.
Step 14: FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on traffic on ports 4369 and 9100. Port 4369 is associated with the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd), and port 9100 is commonly used for printing services. No specific service or application was conclusively identified from the PCAP file. The search for CVEs related to these services did not yield specific identifiers, but general vulnerabilities were noted. The traffic analysis did not reveal any signs of exploitation or malicious activities. Therefore, the services are not confirmed to be vulnerable, and no successful attack was detected.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: N/A
Affected Service: Erlang Port Mapper Daemon and Printing Service
Is Service Vulnerable: False
