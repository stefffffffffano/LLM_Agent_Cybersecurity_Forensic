[Task 16]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates a TCP conversation between two IP addresses on port 61616. This port is commonly associated with Apache ActiveMQ, a popular open-source message broker. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic further to identify any specific protocol or application signatures.

Next, I will use the tshark_expert to extract application layer data or protocol details from the traffic on port 61616 to confirm the service or application involved.

Let's proceed with this analysis. 

High level description of the analysis objective: Extract application layer data or protocol details from the traffic on port 61616 to confirm the service or application involved.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "tcp.port == 61616" -V
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting application layer data or protocol details from traffic on port 61616 to confirm the service or application involved. Initially, a command was executed to display detailed protocol information, revealing the involvement of the OpenWire protocol related to ActiveMQ. An attempt was made to extract specific fields related to the application layer data, but it resulted in an error due to invalid field names. The manual search did not provide the correct field names for OpenWire protocol in tshark, leading to the conclusion that the fields might not be directly available or correctly named in the tshark field list for the OpenWire protocol.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 61616" -T fields -e openwire.magic -e openwire.version -e openwire.provider_name -e openwire.provider_version

Command output: Error: Some fields aren't valid: openwire.provider_version, openwire.provider_name, openwire.version, openwire.magic. This suggests that these fields might not be directly available or correctly named in the tshark field list for the OpenWire protocol.

Step 3: The previous analysis confirmed the involvement of the OpenWire protocol related to Apache ActiveMQ on port 61616. However, the attempt to extract specific fields related to the application layer data resulted in an error due to invalid field names. This suggests that the fields might not be directly available or correctly named in the tshark field list for the OpenWire protocol.

To proceed, I need to identify any known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with Apache ActiveMQ that could be relevant to the captured data. I will perform a web search to find the latest CVEs related to Apache ActiveMQ.

Let's proceed with this search.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'Apache ActiveMQ CVEs'

Step 5: Based on the search results, several CVEs are associated with Apache ActiveMQ. One of the relevant CVEs is CVE-2021-26118, which is a flaw in ActiveMQ Artemis OpenWire support. Since the OpenWire protocol was identified in the traffic, this CVE might be relevant to the captured data.

Next, I need to gather evidence of malicious activities associated with CVE-2021-26118. This CVE involves a flaw in the OpenWire support, so I will analyze the PCAP file for any signs of exploitation attempts or unusual OpenWire protocol behavior.

Let's proceed with this analysis. 

High level description of the analysis objective: Analyze the PCAP file for signs of exploitation attempts or unusual OpenWire protocol behavior related to CVE-2021-26118.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "openwire" -V
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to analyze the OpenWire protocol messages using the field 'openwire.data' resulted in an error, as this field is not valid in the current version of tshark. Despite searching the manual for the correct field names for the OpenWire protocol, I was unable to find a valid field to replace 'openwire.data'. Therefore, I could not proceed with the analysis of OpenWire protocol messages for signs of exploitation attempts or unusual behavior related to CVE-2021-26118.
Executed command: -Y "openwire" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e openwire.command -e openwire.data

Command output: Error: The field 'openwire.data' is not valid in the current version of tshark.

Step 7: The previous analysis attempts to extract OpenWire protocol messages for signs of exploitation related to CVE-2021-26118 were unsuccessful due to invalid field names in tshark. To proceed, I need to explore alternative methods to identify unusual OpenWire protocol behavior or signs of exploitation attempts. 

I will attempt to analyze the TCP stream data directly to identify any anomalies or patterns that could indicate exploitation attempts. This approach will allow me to manually inspect the data for any unusual behavior.

Let's proceed with this analysis.

High level description of the analysis objective: Extract and analyze TCP stream data for anomalies or patterns indicating exploitation attempts related to CVE-2021-26118.
Suggested tshark command: tshark -r <pcap_file> -Y "tcp.port == 61616" -z follow,tcp,ascii,0
Step 8: 
Step 9: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting and examining the TCP stream data for anomalies or patterns that could indicate exploitation attempts related to CVE-2021-26118, which is associated with Apache ActiveMQ. The command used extracted the TCP payload data for the first stream, allowing us to inspect the payload for any unusual patterns or payloads that are not typical for normal ActiveMQ communication. The extracted payload data did not reveal any specific anomalies or patterns directly indicating an exploitation attempt related to CVE-2021-26118.
Executed command: tshark -Y "tcp.stream eq 0" -T fields -e tcp.payload

Command output: 00000152014163746976654d510000000c01000001400000000d0011537461636b5472616365456e61626c65640101000f506c6174666f726d44657461696c730900044a617661000c4361636865456e61626c6564010100115463704e6f44656c6179456e61626c65640101001253697a6550726566697844697361626c656401000009436163686553697a650500000400000c50726f76696465724e616d650900084163746976654d5100145469676874456e636f64696e67456e61626c65640101000c4d61784672616d6553697a6506000000000640000000154d6178496e61637469766974794475726174696f6e06000000000000753000204d6178496e61637469766974794475726174696f6e496e6974616c44656c617906000000000000271000134d61784672616d6553697a65456e61626c65640101000f50726f766964657256657273696f6e090006352e31372e33

Step 10: The previous analysis of the TCP stream data did not reveal any specific anomalies or patterns directly indicating an exploitation attempt related to CVE-2021-26118. Since the OpenWire protocol is involved, and the CVE is related to a flaw in OpenWire support, I need to further assess whether the service is vulnerable to this CVE and if the attack was successful.

To proceed, I will perform a web search to gather more information about the specific conditions or indicators of exploitation for CVE-2021-26118. This will help me understand what to look for in the network traffic to determine if the service is vulnerable and if the attack was successful.
