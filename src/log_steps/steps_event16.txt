[Task 16]
Step 1: The PCAP summary indicates a TCP conversation between two IP addresses on port 61616. This port is commonly associated with Apache ActiveMQ, a popular open-source message broker. However, to confirm the service or application involved, I need to analyze the traffic further to identify any specific application-layer protocols or signatures that can confirm the presence of Apache ActiveMQ or another service.

Next, I will extract application-layer data from the PCAP file to identify the service or application involved.
Step 2: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP conversation on port 61616 revealed the involvement of the OpenWire protocol, which is typically associated with messaging services like Apache ActiveMQ. However, when attempting to extract specific OpenWire messages and their details, an error occurred due to an invalid field name 'openwire.data'. Despite attempts to search the tshark manual for valid OpenWire-related fields, no relevant information was found. Therefore, the analysis could not proceed further to extract detailed application-layer data.
Executed command: -Y "openwire" -T fields -e frame.number -e openwire.command -e openwire.data

Error in the command

Step 3: The analysis of the PCAP file has confirmed the involvement of the OpenWire protocol, which is typically associated with Apache ActiveMQ. However, due to an error in extracting specific OpenWire messages, I was unable to gather detailed application-layer data. To proceed, I need to identify any known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with Apache ActiveMQ that could be relevant to this analysis.

Next, I will perform a web search to identify any CVEs associated with Apache ActiveMQ.
Step 4: Search result for query: 'CVE vulnerabilities Apache ActiveMQ'

Information 5: a - May 1, 2025 A critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-29953) in Apache ActiveMQ’s NMS OpenWire Client has been disclosed, enabling remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. The flaw, rooted in unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, affects versions prior to 2.1.1 and poses significant risks to organizations using the messaging broker for application communication. Apache ActiveMQ Vulnerability The vulnerability stems from the client’s handling of serialized data when connect
Step 5: Based on the web search results, there are several CVEs associated with Apache ActiveMQ. One of the critical vulnerabilities is CVE-2025-29953, which involves unsafe deserialization of untrusted data in Apache ActiveMQ's NMS OpenWire Client, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.1.1.

To gather evidence of malicious activities associated with this CVE, I need to analyze the PCAP file for signs of unsafe deserialization or attempts to execute arbitrary code. This could involve looking for unusual serialized data patterns or unexpected command execution attempts.

Next, I will instruct the "tshark_expert" to analyze the PCAP file for signs of unsafe deserialization or attempts to execute arbitrary code, which are indicative of CVE-2025-29953 exploitation attempts.
Step 6: Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file focused on identifying signs of unsafe deserialization or attempts to execute arbitrary code, which are indicative of CVE-2025-29953 exploitation attempts. The TCP conversation between the two IP addresses on ports 41374 and 61616 was examined. Attempts to extract TCP payload data using specific filters did not yield any output, suggesting no relevant data was captured. A broader examination of the entire TCP stream revealed some encoded or serialized data, potentially related to Java-based messaging or serialization. However, further attempts to identify serialized Java objects using specific byte patterns or keywords were unsuccessful due to limitations in the tshark command options and filters. Therefore, no definitive signs of unsafe deserialization or code execution attempts were found in the provided PCAP file.

Step 7: The analysis of the PCAP file did not reveal any definitive signs of unsafe deserialization or code execution attempts, which are indicative of CVE-2025-29953 exploitation attempts. The TCP conversation between the two IP addresses on ports 41374 and 61616 was examined, and some encoded or serialized data was found, potentially related to Java-based messaging or serialization. However, further attempts to identify serialized Java objects using specific byte patterns or keywords were unsuccessful.

Given this, I need to assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack and evaluate whether the attack was successful. Since no definitive signs of exploitation were found, I will conclude the analysis.

I will now format the final answer with the information gathered.
Step 8: FINAL REPORT:
