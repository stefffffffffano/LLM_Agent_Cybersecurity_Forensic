Number of steps: 20

Input tokens written: 0, output tokens: 0[Task 2]
FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP requests attempting to access sensitive files on the server, such as '/etc/passwd', '/etc/shadow', and other configuration and log files. This indicates a potential directory traversal attack, where the attacker is trying to access files outside the web server's root directory by manipulating the URL path. The HTTP response codes showed a mix of successful (200 OK) and unsuccessful (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found) requests, suggesting that some of the attack attempts were successful while others were blocked or the resources were not found. The absence of User-Agent headers and the presence of encoded characters in the request URIs further suggest the use of automated attack tools or scripts. The executed command successfully extracted the HTTP request URIs, confirming the presence of directory traversal patterns.

Input tokens written: 0, output tokens: 0[Task 3]
FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts. The HTTP requests and responses did not reveal any specific application or service names in the headers or payloads. Attempts to extract additional HTTP headers for application or service names were unsuccessful due to invalid field names. The server was identified as a web server, likely vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, but the attack was not successful due to the server's security measures.
