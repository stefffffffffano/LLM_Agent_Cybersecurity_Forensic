[Task 9]
FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file has revealed multiple connection attempts to a MySQL service on port 3306, with initial failures followed by successful connections. This pattern suggests a potential brute force attack aimed at unauthorized access. The most relevant CVE for this scenario is CVE-2012-2122, which involves a logic error in MySQL's authentication process, allowing attackers to authenticate with incorrect passwords after several failed attempts. The analysis of specific frames, such as Frame 28, Frame 30, and Frame 38, confirms successful TCP handshakes and data exchanges between the client and the MySQL server, indicating that the connection was not only established but also used for data transmission. This supports the hypothesis of a brute force attack, as unauthorized access may have been achieved, allowing data manipulation or extraction.

[Task 11]
FINAL REPORT:
The analysis of the PCAP file confirms the presence of Redis commands, specifically the BRPOP command, indicating that the service involved is Redis. The traffic is consistent with typical Redis operations. Based on the web search, CVE-2021-41099 is identified as a relevant vulnerability where the BRPOP command can be exploited by unauthenticated users to cause a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is significant when Redis is exposed on untrusted networks. The PCAP file shows a significant amount of traffic between IP addresses 172.18.0.3 and other IPs, primarily on port 6379, which is commonly associated with Redis. The traffic pattern suggests a potential interaction with a Redis server, possibly involving multiple clients. However, there is no direct evidence in the PCAP file indicating a successful DoS attack, such as a sudden drop in service availability or abnormal traffic patterns that would suggest a service disruption. Therefore, while the service is vulnerable to CVE-2021-41099, there is no conclusive evidence of a successful attack in this instance.

[Task 12]
FINAL REPORT:
The PCAP file analysis reveals that the SaltStack service was involved in a series of TCP connections on port 4506, which is associated with the SaltStack service. The presence of multiple TCP packets with PA (Push Acknowledgment) and Raw data suggests data exchange, possibly indicating a command or data transfer. The most relevant CVE identified is CVE-2020-11651, which allows remote authentication bypass and arbitrary command execution on the Salt master. The extracted frame data shows a TCP packet with a Push Acknowledgment (PA) flag, indicating data transfer between the two IP addresses on port 4506. The presence of raw data in the payload suggests that commands or data are being exchanged, which aligns with the behavior of a command execution vulnerability. The sequence of packets, including the establishment and termination of the connection, indicates a complete data exchange, which could imply successful exploitation.
REPORT SUMMARY:
Identified CVE: CVE-2020-11651
Affected Service: SaltStack

[Task 14]
The analysis of Frame 17 reveals a TCP segment with no payload, indicating a connection termination attempt from 172.18.0.3 to 172.18.0.2 on port 2379. This frame does not provide evidence of malicious activity associated with the CVE-2023-3044. The previous frames analyzed, particularly those involving the `/v3/lease/grant` endpoint, do not show immediate evidence of a denial-of-service attack as described in CVE-2023-3044. However, the presence of many RST (reset) packets in the overall communication could indicate an attempt to disrupt the service.

Next, I will continue to gather evidence of malicious activities by analyzing additional frames with payloads to look for any anomalies or indications of a denial-of-service attempt. I will proceed with Frame 18, which also contains a payload.

[Task 15]
The analysis of Frame 6 indicates that there is a TCP packet with a payload being sent from source IP 172.18.0.3 to destination IP 172.18.0.2 on port 2379, which is associated with the etcd service. The packet contains a SYN-ACK flag, indicating the establishment of a TCP connection. The presence of a payload suggests data is being transmitted, which could be relevant for identifying malicious activities.

The next step is to analyze the payload data in this frame to determine if it contains any indicators of malicious activity or if it aligns with any known vulnerabilities associated with etcd. This will help in identifying the specific CVE that might be exploited. Let's extract the payload data from Frame 6 for further analysis.
