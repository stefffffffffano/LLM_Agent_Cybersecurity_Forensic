TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract Redis commands using the field 'redis.command' resulted in an error, indicating that this field might not be valid or available in the current version of the PCAP file or tshark. Despite searching the tshark manual for Redis-related fields or filters, no valid field was found to extract Redis commands directly. Therefore, no output was obtained for the given command.
Executed command: -Y "redis" -T fields -e redis.command

Error in the command
