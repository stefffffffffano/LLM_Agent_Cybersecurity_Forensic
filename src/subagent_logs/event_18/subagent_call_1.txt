A variable using a sigil with the form $some.proto.field or ${some.proto.field} is called a field
reference. A field reference is a field value read from the currently
selected frame in the GUI. This is useful to build dynamic filters such as,
frames since the last five minutes to the selected frame:
frame.time_relative >= ${frame.time_relative} - 300
or more simply
frame.time_relative >= $frame.time_relative - 300
Field references share a similar notation to macros but are distinct

Final report from the forensic expert:
After several attempts to extract Redis commands using the field `data.text`, no output was found. This suggests that the field used might not be correct for capturing Redis commands. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct field name, no suitable field was identified. Therefore, the final result is that no Redis commands or patterns were extracted from the traffic on port 6379 using the attempted method.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
