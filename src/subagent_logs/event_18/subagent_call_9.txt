the packet number, the protocol that had that credential, the username and
the password. For protocols just using one single field as authentication,
this is provided as a password and a placeholder in place of the user.
Currently implemented protocols include FTP, HTTP, IMAP, POP, and SMTP.

Final report from the forensic expert:
Despite multiple attempts to extract Redis commands or patterns from the PCAP file using tshark, no output was found. I tried extracting both text and raw data from packets on port 6379, as well as attempting to extract data in hexadecimal format. Unfortunately, none of these methods yielded any results. This could indicate that the traffic does not contain any recognizable Redis commands or patterns, or that the data is not in a format that tshark can interpret as such.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
