The simplest filter allows you to check for the existence of a protocol or
field.  If you want to see all packets which contain the IP protocol, the
filter would be "ip" (without the quotation marks). To see all packets
that contain a Token-Ring RIF field, use "tr.rif".
Whenever a protocol or field appears as the argument of a function in a filter,
an exists operator for that protocol or field implicitly appears.
Values and operators
Each field has a value, and that value can be used in operations with

ip.addr eq sneezy/24
The CIDR notation can only be used on IP addresses or hostnames, not in
variable names.  So, a display filter like "ip.src/24 == ip.dst/24" is
not valid (yet).
Transaction and other IDs are often represented by unsigned 16 or 32 bit integers
and formatted as a hexadecimal string with "0x" prefix:
(dhcp.id == 0xfe089c15) || (ip.id == 0x0373)
Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify the presence of the `XAUTOCLAIM` command or any unusual patterns in the Redis traffic on port 6379. Initial attempts to filter Redis commands using a specific field were unsuccessful due to the absence of a recognized field for Redis commands in tshark. Subsequent efforts to search for the `XAUTOCLAIM` command in packet data using the `data.text` field also failed due to syntax issues with the filter. As a result, no specific signs of the `XAUTOCLAIM` command or unusual patterns related to CVE-2022-31144 were identified in the traffic.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379 && data.text contains 'XAUTOCLAIM'" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e data.text
