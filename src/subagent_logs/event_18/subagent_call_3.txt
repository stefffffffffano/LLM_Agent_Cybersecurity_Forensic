DESCRIPTION
TShark
is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved

**Similarity: 0.32**
TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

each packet read.
TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract raw payload data for Redis traffic on port 6379 using the field 'data' did not yield any output. This suggests that the field name might be incorrect or the packets do not contain the expected data field. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct field name, no alternative field was identified. Therefore, the analysis could not proceed further without the correct field name for extracting raw payload data in TCP packets. The executed command did not produce any results, indicating that either the field was not present or the command was not correctly formulated.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
