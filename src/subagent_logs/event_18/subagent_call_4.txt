Note
One important thing to note here is that the filter is not optional
and that the field that the calculation is based on MUST be part of the filter
string or the calculation will fail.
So:
-z io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)
does not work.  Use

If the timezone is omitted then date and time values are interpreted as local time.
The slice operator
You can take a slice of a field if the field base type is a text string or a
byte array (the base type of most network address fields is bytes).
For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.

An integer or boolean field that has a value string can be compared to
to one of the strings that corresponds with a value.
As with stringlike fields and comparisons, it is possible to perform
the comparison with an unquoted literal, though this is deprecated and
will not work if the literal contains a space (as with "Modify Bearer
Response" above). Double quotes are recommended.

Caution
In tshark single-pass mode, external resolution and geolocation lookup is
performed synchronously. For live captures, which are always in single-pass
mode, this makes it more difficult for dissection to keep up with a busy
network, possibly leading to dropped packets.
