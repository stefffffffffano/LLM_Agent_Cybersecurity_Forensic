data.
The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

If the timezone is omitted then date and time values are interpreted as local time.
The slice operator
You can take a slice of a field if the field base type is a text string or a
byte array (the base type of most network address fields is bytes).
For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.

The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.
token[0:5] ne 0.0.0.1.1
llc[0] eq aa
frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length
[i-j]    i = start_offset, j = end_offset, inclusive.
[i]      i = start_offset, length = 1
[:j]     start_offset = 0, length = j
[i:]     start_offset = i, end_offset = end_of_field
Slice indexes are zero-based.

Example 1. Decode As Port
-d tcp.port==8888,http
will decode any traffic running over
TCP port 8888 as HTTP.
Example 2. Decode As Port Range
-d tcp.port==8888-8890,http

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract Redis traffic using the '-e data' field did not yield any output, indicating that the field name might not be correct for extracting Redis command data. Despite multiple attempts to search the tshark manual for the correct field name, no suitable field was identified for extracting Redis command data.

Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
