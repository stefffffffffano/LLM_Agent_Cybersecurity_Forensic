Result of command {'tshark_command': '-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -x'}:  Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.

The previous command output was too long, so I need to refine the command to focus on specific Redis command patterns that could indicate unauthorized access or exploitation attempts. Redis commands are typically sent in plain text, and common unauthorized access attempts might include commands like `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`, `SLAVEOF`, or `SET`.

I will refine the command to search for these specific Redis command patterns within the payload data. Let's execute the following tshark command to filter for these patterns:

```tshark
-Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (data contains 'FLUSHALL' || data contains 'CONFIG' || data contains 'SLAVEOF' || data contains 'SET')" -x
```

TOOL CALL:
- tool name: command_executor
- args: {
  "tshark_command": "-Y \"tcp.port == 6379 && (data contains 'FLUSHALL' || data contains 'CONFIG' || data contains 'SLAVEOF' || data contains 'SET')\" -x"
}

---


Result of command {'tshark_command': '-Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (data contains \'FLUSHALL\' || data contains \'CONFIG\' || data contains \'SLAVEOF\' || data contains \'SET\')" -x'}:  Error: Command '['tshark', '-r', 'C:\\Users\\Stefano\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic\\src\\data\\raw\\eventID_18\\cve-2021-22205_fail.pcap', '-Y', "tcp.port == 6379 && (data contains 'FLUSHALL' || data contains 'CONFIG' || data contains 'SLAVEOF' || data contains 'SET')", '-x']' returned non-zero exit status 4.
tshark: 'FLUSHALL' is too long to be a valid character constant.
    tcp.port == 6379 && (data contains 'FLUSHALL' || data contains 'CONFIG' || data contains 'SLAVEOF' || data contains 'SET')

should expect UTF-8 and be prepared for invalid output.
If
TShark
detects that it is writing to a TTY on a UNIX-compatible
system, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and the locale
does not support UTF-8, output will be re-encoded to match the current
locale.
If
TShark
detects that it is writing to the console on Windows,
dissection output will be encoded as UTF-16LE. Other output will be
UTF-8. If extended characters donâ€™t display properly in your terminal

ebcdic EBCDIC output with dots for non-printable characters

each section of output is preceded by its length in bytes plus a newline.

TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.
