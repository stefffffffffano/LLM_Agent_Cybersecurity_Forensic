Final report from the forensic expert:
Despite multiple attempts to extract PostgreSQL-related fields from the PCAP file, all efforts resulted in errors due to invalid field names or incorrect command syntax. Manual searches for PostgreSQL protocol fields in the tshark documentation did not yield relevant information. As a result, I was unable to extract application-layer data for PostgreSQL commands or responses from the traffic on port 5432.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 5432" -T fields -e pgsql.query -e pgsql.response

Error in the command
