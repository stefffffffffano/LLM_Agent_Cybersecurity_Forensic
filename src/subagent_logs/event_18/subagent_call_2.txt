The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

layer type should be dissected.  If the layer type in question (for example,
tcp.port
or
udp.port
for a TCP or UDP port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.
Example 1. Decode As Port
-d tcp.port==8888,http
will decode any traffic running over
TCP port 8888 as HTTP.
Example 2. Decode As Port Range
-d tcp.port==8888-8890,http
will decode any traffic running
over TCP ports 8888, 8889 or 8890 as HTTP.
Example 3. Decode As Port Range via Length

Final report from the forensic expert:
After attempting to extract raw payload data using the command '-T fields -e data', no output was found. This could be due to the absence of the 'data' field in the packets. Further attempts to find Redis-specific fields or display filters in the tshark manual did not yield any new information. Therefore, no specific Redis commands or patterns indicating unauthorized access or exploitation attempts were identified in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
