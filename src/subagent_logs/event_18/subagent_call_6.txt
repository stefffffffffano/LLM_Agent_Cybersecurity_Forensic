Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract Redis commands using the field 'data.text' did not yield any results. This suggests that the field might not be the correct one for capturing Redis command payloads in this PCAP file. Despite attempts to search the tshark manual for the correct field, no conclusive information was found. Therefore, the task to extract specific Redis commands or patterns indicating unauthorized access or exploitation attempts on port 6379 could not be completed with the available information.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
