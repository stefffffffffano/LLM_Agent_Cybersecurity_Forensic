Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify signs of remote code execution or unusual behavior related to CVE-2022-31144 by examining traffic on port 6379. The initial attempt to extract payload data using the field 'data' resulted in no output, indicating either the absence of payload data or an incorrect field specification. Despite multiple attempts to find the correct field for TCP payload data extraction through manual searches, no relevant information was found. Therefore, the analysis could not proceed further to identify anomalies in payload sizes or patterns that might suggest exploitation attempts.
