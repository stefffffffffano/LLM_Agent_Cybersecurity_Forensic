The following command displays five columns: the total number of frames and bytes
(transferred bidirectionally) using a single comma, the same two stats using the FRAMES and BYTES
subcommands, the total number of frames containing at least one SMB Read response, and
the total number of bytes transmitted to the client (unidirectionally) at IP address 10.1.0.64.

TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark

doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the

You will also get the number of Open Requests (Unresponded Requests),
Discarded Responses (Responses without matching request) and Duplicate Messages.
Example:
tshark -z h225_ras,rtd
This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
Example:
-z "h225_ras,rtd,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"
will only collect stats for
ITU-T H.225 RAS packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .
-z

Calculate statistics on HART-IP packets, grouping by message types and

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract Redis commands using the field 'redis.command' resulted in an error, indicating that this field is not valid. This suggests that the field name might be incorrect or not supported by the version of tshark being used. Despite searching the tshark manual for Redis-related fields or methods, no valid field name or method was found to extract Redis commands directly from the PCAP file. Therefore, no specific Redis commands or patterns indicating unauthorized access or exploitation attempts on port 6379 could be extracted using tshark.
Executed command: -Y 'tcp.port == 6379' -T fields -e redis.command

Error in the command
