the raw packet data for the field.
A character string must be decoded from a source encoding during dissection.
If there are decoding errors the resulting string will usually contain
replacement characters:
browser.comment == "string is ����"
The at operator allows testing the raw undecoded data:
@browser.comment == 73:74:72:69:6e:67:20:69:73:20:aa:aa:aa:aa
The syntactical rules for a bytes field type apply to the second example.

extract default field set from diameter CC messages.
Extract most important fields from diameter CC messages:
tshark -r file.cap.gz -q -z diameter,avp,272,CC-Request-Type,CC-Request-Number,Session-Id,Subscription-Id-Data,Rating-Group,Result-Code
Following fields will be printed out for each diameter message:
"frame"        Frame number.
"time"         Unix time of the frame arrival.
"src"          Source address.
"srcport"      Source port.
"dst"          Destination address.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to confirm the presence of Redis traffic on port 6379 and identify any unusual patterns or commands. Initial attempts to extract Redis command data using `-e data.text` and `-e data` did not yield any output, suggesting that the data might not be in a format directly interpretable as text. Further attempts to extract raw payload data using the `-x` option resulted in an output that was too long to process effectively. This indicates a significant amount of traffic on port 6379, but without specific Redis command data being extracted, it is challenging to confirm the presence of Redis or identify unusual patterns. The executed command was intended to provide a hex and ASCII dump of the packet data for manual inspection, but the volume of data was too large to handle in this context.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -x

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
