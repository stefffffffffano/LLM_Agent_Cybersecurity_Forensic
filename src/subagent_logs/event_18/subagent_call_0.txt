Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract application-layer data from TCP traffic on port 6379 to verify the presence of Redis commands or responses. Multiple attempts were made to extract the payload data using different approaches, including filtering for non-zero payload length and limiting the number of packets. However, all attempts resulted in either no output or outputs that were too long to process effectively. This suggests that the PCAP file may not contain recognizable Redis commands or responses in the captured traffic, or the data is not in a format that can be easily extracted using the available tshark options.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379 && tcp.len > 0" -T fields -e tcp.payload

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
