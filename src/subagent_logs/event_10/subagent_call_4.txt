Result of command {'tshark_command': '-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data'}:  No output found for the given command.

---

The previous command did not yield any output, which suggests that the data field might not be populated or the filter might not be capturing the expected data. To further investigate, I will attempt to extract the application layer data using a different approach. Instead of focusing solely on the data field, I will try to capture the entire packet content in a raw format, which might provide more insight into the traffic.

I will execute the following command to extract the raw packet data for traffic on port 6379:

```bash
tshark -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -x
```

---

The previous command executed to extract raw packet data for traffic on port 6379 did not yield any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with the way the data is being captured or displayed. To address this, I will attempt to extract the application layer data using a different approach by focusing on the Redis protocol specifically. Redis typically uses a specific protocol format, so I will try to capture any Redis protocol messages.

I will execute the following command to extract Redis protocol messages:

```bash
tshark -Y "redis" -T fields -e redis.command
```

is displayed in the list of packets.  Display filters let you compare the
fields within a protocol against a specific value, compare fields against
fields, and check the existence of specified fields or protocols.

The simplest filter allows you to check for the existence of a protocol or
field.  If you want to see all packets which contain the IP protocol, the
filter would be "ip" (without the quotation marks). To see all packets
that contain a Token-Ring RIF field, use "tr.rif".
Whenever a protocol or field appears as the argument of a function in a filter,
an exists operator for that protocol or field implicitly appears.

Each field has a value, and that value can be used in operations with
