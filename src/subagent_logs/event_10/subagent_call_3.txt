Do not confuse this usage of curly brackets with set membership.
An unfortunate quirk in the filter syntax is that the subtraction operator
must be preceded by a space character, so "A-B" must be written as "A -B"
or "A - B".
Protocol field references
A variable using a sigil with the form $some.proto.field or ${some.proto.field} is called a field
reference. A field reference is a field value read from the currently
selected frame in the GUI. This is useful to build dynamic filters such as,

Add a field to the list of fields to display if

At least one field must be provided if the

selected. Column types may be used prefixed with "_ws.col."
Example:
tshark -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.addr -e udp -e _ws.col.info
Fields are separated by tab characters by default.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify any instances of the 'XAUTOCLAIM' command in the Redis traffic on port 6379, which could indicate remote code execution attempts. Initially, an attempt was made to filter for the 'XAUTOCLAIM' command using a specific Redis field, but it resulted in an error due to an invalid field name. Subsequent attempts to find the correct field name in the tshark manual were unsuccessful. As an alternative approach, a search was conducted for the 'XAUTOCLAIM' string directly in the packet data using a display filter. However, no output was found for this command, indicating that there were no instances of the 'XAUTOCLAIM' command in the packet data.
Executed command: -Y 'frame contains "XAUTOCLAIM"' -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
