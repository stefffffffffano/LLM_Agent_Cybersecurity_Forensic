The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

Extract most important fields from diameter CC messages:
tshark -r file.cap.gz -q -z diameter,avp,272,CC-Request-Type,CC-Request-Number,Session-Id,Subscription-Id-Data,Rating-Group,Result-Code
Following fields will be printed out for each diameter message:
"frame"        Frame number.
"time"         Unix time of the frame arrival.
"src"          Source address.
"srcport"      Source port.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract application layer data using the field name 'data' did not yield any output. This suggests that the field name might be incorrect or not applicable for the data we are trying to extract. Despite searching the tshark manual for guidance on extracting application layer data for Redis traffic or similar protocols, no alternative field name or method was identified. Therefore, the command executed did not provide any output, and no further analysis could be conducted on the application layer data for Redis traffic.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
