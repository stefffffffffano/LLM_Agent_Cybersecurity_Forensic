TShark

each packet read.
TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
packet details printed with the

option
will add color attributes to
pdml

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial command to extract raw TCP payloads from traffic on port 6379 did not yield any output. After consulting the tshark manual, it was determined that the command syntax was correct, but the field name for extracting raw data might not have been appropriate. Despite multiple attempts to verify the field name, no alternative was found. Therefore, the command executed did not produce any results.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
