AUTHORS
TShark
uses the same packet dissection code that
Wireshark
does,
as well as using many other modules from
Wireshark
; see the list of
authors in the
Wireshark
man page for a list of authors of that code.

TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract the raw payload data from the Redis traffic on port 6379 using the field 'data.text' did not yield any output. This suggests that the field used was incorrect for extracting the payload data in this context. Despite efforts to search the tshark manual for the correct field name, no suitable alternative was identified. Therefore, the analysis could not proceed further in identifying signs of remote code execution attempts or unusual patterns in the Redis traffic.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
