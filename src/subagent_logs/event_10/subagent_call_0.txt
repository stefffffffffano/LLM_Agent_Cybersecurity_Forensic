Final report from the forensic expert:
Despite multiple attempts to extract application layer data from TCP traffic on port 6379, no output was found. This suggests that the Redis protocol, commonly associated with port 6379, might not be directly recognized by tshark in this context. Attempts to use general fields like 'data.text' and 'data' also resulted in no output. Without specific Redis protocol fields or filters available in tshark, the application layer data could not be extracted from the provided PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
