each packet read.
TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

DESCRIPTION
TShark
is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.
TShark
's native
capture file format is
pcapng
format, which is also the format used
by
Wireshark
and various other tools.
Without any options set,
