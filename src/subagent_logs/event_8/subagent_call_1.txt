The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers, revealing several GET and POST requests to 'localhost:8080' with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. The URIs included paths like '//index.php', '//import.php', and a potentially suspicious one with a query string that includes '../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43', indicating an attempt to access sensitive files or directories.

Executed command: -Y "http.response && http.content_type contains \"text/html\"" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase -e http.file_data

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
