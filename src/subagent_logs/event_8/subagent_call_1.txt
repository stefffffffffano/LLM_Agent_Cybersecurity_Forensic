Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to confirm the presence of the MySQL service by extracting MySQL protocol details from the traffic on port 3306. Initially, I attempted to extract MySQL protocol details using a general command, but the output was too large. I then attempted to refine the command by using the '-T fields' option to select specific fields related to the MySQL protocol. However, I was unable to identify the appropriate fields for MySQL protocol details from the manual search. As a result, I could not refine the command further to extract specific MySQL protocol details.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
