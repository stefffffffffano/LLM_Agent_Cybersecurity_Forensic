Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote
or an arbitrary byte represented in either octal or hexadecimal.
browser.comment == "An embedded \" double-quote"
Use of hexadecimal to look for "HEAD":

Use of hexadecimal to look for "HEAD":

This means that you must escape backslashes with backslashes inside
double quotes.

that of the right hand side after any implicit or explicit conversions.
For example, to search for a given HTTP
URL in a capture, the following filter can be used:
http contains "https://www.wireshark.org"
The "contains" operator cannot be used on atomic fields,
such as numbers or IP addresses.
The "matches" or "~" operator allows a filter to apply to a specified
Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE2).  The regular expression must
be a double quoted string.  The left hand side of the "matches" operator

TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying potential path traversal attempts in HTTP traffic. A suspicious URI was identified: `//index.php?target=db_sql.php%253f/../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43`, which contained encoded path traversal patterns. Attempts to filter the HTTP response associated with this URI using tshark were unsuccessful due to character limit constraints in the filter string. Despite efforts to simplify the filter, no successful command execution was achieved to extract the HTTP response for this specific URI pattern. Therefore, the analysis could not conclusively determine if the path traversal attempt was successful based on the available data.
