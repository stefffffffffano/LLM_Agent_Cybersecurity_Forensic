For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.
The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.
token[0:5] ne 0.0.0.1.1
llc[0] eq aa
frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length

Remember that whenever a protocol or field name occurs in an expression, the
"exists" operator is implicitly called. The "exists" operator has the highest
priority. This means that the first filter expression must be read as "show me

specifies the stream to be displayed. There are three formats:
ip-addr0:port0,ip-addr1:port1
stream-index
stream-index,substream-index
The first format specifies IP addresses and TCP, UDP, or DCCP port pairs.
(TCP ports are used for TLS, HTTP, and HTTP2; QUIC does not support address

The syntactical rules for a bytes field type apply to the second example.
The membership operator
A field may be checked for matches against a set of values simply with the
membership operator. For instance, you may find traffic on common HTTP/HTTPS
ports with the following filter:
tcp.port in {80,443,8080}
as opposed to the more verbose:

The set of values can also contain ranges:

Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract HTTP response bodies to check for any file content that might have been accessed due to a path traversal attempt. Initially, I attempted to extract HTTP response bodies, but the output was too long. I then refined the command to focus on specific HTTP response fields like 'Content-Type' and 'Content-Length', but the output was still too long. I attempted to further refine the command by filtering HTTP responses with specific 'Content-Type' values that might indicate file content, such as 'text/html' or 'application/octet-stream'. However, I was unable to execute a command that provided a manageable output size. Therefore, I could not extract specific HTTP response bodies that might indicate file content accessed due to a path traversal attempt.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.content_type -e http.content_length -e http.file_data

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
