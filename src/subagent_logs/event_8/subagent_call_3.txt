Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to confirm the presence of the MySQL service by extracting MySQL protocol details from traffic on port 3306. Initially, the command to extract MySQL protocol details resulted in an output that was too long. Attempts were made to refine the command using the '-T fields' option to select specific fields related to the MySQL protocol. However, the search for appropriate MySQL-related fields in the tshark manual did not yield any specific results. Therefore, the task could not be completed with the information available.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
