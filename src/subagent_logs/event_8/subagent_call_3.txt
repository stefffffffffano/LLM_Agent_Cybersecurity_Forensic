The HTTP request URIs extracted from the PCAP file show a suspicious pattern: `//index.php?target=db_sql.php%253f/../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43`. This pattern includes encoded path traversal sequences (`%253f/../../../../../../../../`) which could indicate an attempt to access files outside the intended directory structure.

To further investigate this potential path traversal attack, I will decode the suspicious URI to understand the exact file path being accessed. This will help confirm if the path traversal attack is indeed being attempted.

I will decode the URI manually to see the actual path being accessed.
The suspicious URI `//index.php?target=db_sql.php%253f/../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43` contains encoded characters. The sequence `%253f` is a double-encoded question mark (`%3f`), which is often used in path traversal attacks to bypass filters.

Decoding the URI, we get: `//index.php?target=db_sql.php?/../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_527caf74057af1fa755015245a936e43`. This indicates an attempt to access a session file located in the `/tmp` directory by traversing up the directory structure.

This confirms the presence of a path traversal attack attempt in the HTTP traffic. I will now format the final answer with this analysis.
