Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the HTTP traffic in the provided PCAP file revealed several HTTP requests and responses. The requests were primarily GET and POST methods targeting localhost:8080, with the user agent 'python-requests/2.22.0'. The requested URIs included PHP scripts, and one URI contained a suspicious path traversal attempt. The HTTP responses included status codes 200 and 302, with content types indicating HTML content. The extraction of full HTTP headers was attempted, but an error occurred due to an invalid field. Despite this, the extracted information provides valuable insights into the nature of the HTTP traffic, indicating potential security concerns such as path traversal attempts.
