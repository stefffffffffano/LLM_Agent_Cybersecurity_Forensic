EUI64 address

The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.
