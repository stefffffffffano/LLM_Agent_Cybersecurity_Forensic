The previous command to list all HTTP traffic did not yield any output, indicating that there might not be any HTTP traffic in the PCAP file. Since the PCAP summary provided earlier shows only TCP traffic between two specific IP addresses and ports, it is possible that the traffic is not HTTP but another protocol over TCP. 

To further investigate, I will check if there are any other protocols present in the PCAP file that might be relevant to the analysis. This will help determine if the traffic is using a different protocol that could still be relevant to the task.

Let's execute a command to list all protocols present in the PCAP file:

```tshark
-q -z io,phs
```

- tool name: command_executor

  "tshark_command": "-q -z io,phs"

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract HTTP requests and their headers to identify potential cross-site scripting attempts. However, the PCAP file did not contain any HTTP traffic. Instead, it included other protocols such as OpenWire over TCP. Therefore, the task could not be completed as intended due to the absence of HTTP traffic.
Executed command: -q -z io,phs
