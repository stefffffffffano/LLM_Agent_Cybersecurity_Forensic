A field may be checked for matches against a set of values simply with the
membership operator. For instance, you may find traffic on common HTTP/HTTPS
ports with the following filter:
tcp.port in {80,443,8080}
as opposed to the more verbose:
tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 or tcp.port == 8080
To find HTTP requests using the HEAD or GET methods:
http.request.method in {"HEAD", "GET"}
The set of values can also contain ranges:
tcp.port in {443, 4430..4434}

(dhcp.id == 0xfe089c15) || (ip.id == 0x0373)
Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote
or an arbitrary byte represented in either octal or hexadecimal.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis revealed that the traffic in the PCAP file is not HTTP but rather uses the Openwire protocol, which is associated with ActiveMQ, a message broker service. This explains the absence of HTTP requests and methods in the previous attempts. The task of extracting HTTP requests and their methods is not applicable to this PCAP file due to the lack of HTTP traffic.
