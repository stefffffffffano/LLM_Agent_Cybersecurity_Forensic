The initial inspection of the packets between the specified IP addresses and ports shows a series of TCP packets, including SYN, ACK, PSH, and FIN flags. However, to identify potential signs of remote code execution or deserialization of untrusted data, we need to examine the payloads of these packets more closely.

The packet with the PSH flag (packet number 14) is of particular interest because it indicates that data is being pushed to the receiving end. This could potentially contain the payload we are interested in.

Let's extract the payload data from this packet to analyze its contents for any signs of exploitation or suspicious activity.

I will execute a command to extract the payload data from packet number 14. 

Executing the command:

`tshark -Y "frame.number==14" -x`

The payload extracted from packet number 14 shows the ASCII representation "exit" followed by a carriage return and line feed. This could potentially be a command being sent over the network, which might be indicative of remote code execution attempts or deserialization of untrusted data.

To further investigate, I will look for any other packets in the conversation that might contain similar payloads or commands. This will help in identifying any patterns or sequences that could be related to CVE-2023-46604 exploitation.

Let's execute a command to extract the payload data from all packets in the conversation to analyze their contents for any signs of exploitation or suspicious activity.

Executing the command:

`tshark -Y "ip.src==172.18.0.1 && ip.dst==172.18.0.2 && tcp.srcport==55040 && tcp.dstport==61616" -x`

---

The previous command executed was intended to extract the payload data from all packets in the conversation between the specified IP addresses and ports. However, the output might be too large, and we need to focus on identifying any signs of remote code execution attempts or deserialization of untrusted data.

To refine the analysis, I will focus on extracting only the payload data from packets that contain actual data (i.e., those with a non-zero length). This will help in identifying any suspicious payloads without overwhelming output.

Let's execute a command to extract the payload data from packets with a non-zero length in the conversation.

`tshark -Y "ip.src==172.18.0.1 && ip.dst==172.18.0.2 && tcp.srcport==55040 && tcp.dstport==61616 && tcp.len>0" -x`
