TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark

doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the

Final report from the forensic expert:
After multiple attempts to extract application layer data from the TCP traffic on port 61616 using various tshark fields, no output was found. This suggests that the data might not be in a format that tshark can interpret directly using the fields attempted. The commands executed included attempts to extract text and raw data, but both resulted in no output. Further investigation into the specific protocol or data format used on port 61616 might be necessary to proceed with the analysis.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 61616" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
