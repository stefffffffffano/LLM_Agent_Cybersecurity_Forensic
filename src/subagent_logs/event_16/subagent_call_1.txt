Final report from the forensic expert:
The TCP flags extracted from the conversation on port 61616 were decoded to identify any anomalies. The sequence of flags indicates a typical TCP handshake and data transfer process, followed by a connection termination. However, the presence of two FIN, ACK flags in sequence might suggest an anomaly or a retransmission. This could be indicative of a network issue or an attempt to close the connection from both ends simultaneously.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 61616" -T fields -e tcp.flags
