TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in

For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.
The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark

is displayed in the list of packets.  Display filters let you compare the
fields within a protocol against a specific value, compare fields against
