The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.

The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length
[i-j]    i = start_offset, j = end_offset, inclusive.
[i]      i = start_offset, length = 1
[:j]     start_offset = 0, length = j
[i:]     start_offset = i, end_offset = end_of_field
Slice indexes are zero-based.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract identifiable application layer data or patterns from traffic on port 6379, typically associated with Redis. Initial attempts to extract application layer data using the `-e data` field yielded no results. Further attempts to find Redis-specific fields in the tshark manual did not provide useful information. Given these constraints, no identifiable application layer data or patterns indicating a different service or application were found in the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
