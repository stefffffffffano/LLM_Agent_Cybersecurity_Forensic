Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempts to extract Redis command patterns using the 'data.text' field did not yield any results. This suggests that the Redis commands might be encoded differently or stored in another field. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct field name, no additional information was found to adjust the command. Therefore, the final result is that no Redis command patterns like 'AUTH', 'PING', 'SET', 'GET', 'DEL' were found in the traffic on port 6379 using the attempted method.
Executed command: -Y 'tcp.port == 6379 && (data.text contains "AUTH" || data.text contains "PING" || data.text contains "SET" || data.text contains "GET" || data.text contains "DEL")' -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
