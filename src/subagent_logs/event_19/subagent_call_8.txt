frame exists, in other words the length of the frame is at least 200.
Because each comparison has an implicit exists test for field values care must
be taken when using the display filter to remove noise from
the packet trace. If, for example, you want to filter out all IP
multicast packets to address 224.1.2.3, then using:
ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3
may be too restrictive. This is the same as writing:
ip.dst and ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3
The filter selects only frames that have the "ip.dst" field. Any

Boolean values are either true or false.  In a display filter expression
testing the value of a Boolean field, true is expressed as the word
true
(case-insensitive) or any non-zero number.  False is expressed as
false
(case-insensitive) or the number zero. For example, a token-ring packetâ€™s
source route field is Boolean.  To find any source-routed packets, a display

The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.
token[0:5] ne 0.0.0.1.1
llc[0] eq aa
frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length
[i-j]    i = start_offset, j = end_offset, inclusive.
[i]      i = start_offset, length = 1
[:j]     start_offset = 0, length = j
[i:]     start_offset = i, end_offset = end_of_field
Slice indexes are zero-based.

For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.
