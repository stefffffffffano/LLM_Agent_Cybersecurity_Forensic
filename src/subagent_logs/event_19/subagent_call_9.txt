The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

If the timezone is omitted then date and time values are interpreted as local time.
The slice operator
You can take a slice of a field if the field base type is a text string or a
byte array (the base type of most network address fields is bytes).
For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.

The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.
token[0:5] ne 0.0.0.1.1
llc[0] eq aa
frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length
[i-j]    i = start_offset, j = end_offset, inclusive.
[i]      i = start_offset, length = 1
[:j]     start_offset = 0, length = j
[i:]     start_offset = i, end_offset = end_of_field
Slice indexes are zero-based.

the raw packet data for the field.
A character string must be decoded from a source encoding during dissection.
If there are decoding errors the resulting string will usually contain
replacement characters:
browser.comment == "string is ����"
The at operator allows testing the raw undecoded data:
@browser.comment == 73:74:72:69:6e:67:20:69:73:20:aa:aa:aa:aa

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract Redis protocol data using the field 'data.text' did not yield any output. This could be due to the incorrect field name or the absence of data in that specific field. Despite multiple attempts to search the tshark manual for the correct field name to extract application layer data for Redis traffic, no suitable field name was identified. Therefore, the command executed did not produce any results.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
