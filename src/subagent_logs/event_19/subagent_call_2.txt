TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark

-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract Redis protocol commands using the '-e data' field did not yield any output, indicating that the data might be stored in a different field. Redis uses a simple text-based protocol, so the commands might be stored in a field that captures text-based data. However, after searching the tshark manual for information on extracting text-based protocol data or Redis-specific fields, no suitable field was identified. Therefore, the command executed did not provide the expected output.
Executed command: tshark -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Error in the command
