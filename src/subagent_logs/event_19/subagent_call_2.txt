Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract identifiable application layer data or patterns from traffic on port 6379 to determine if a different service or application is present. Initial attempts to extract data using the 'data' field yielded no output, likely due to incorrect field usage. Subsequent attempts using 'tcp.payload' resulted in excessive output, indicating the presence of data but without specific patterns or keywords to filter non-standard Redis traffic. Manual searches for relevant filters or fields to identify non-standard Redis traffic did not provide useful information. Therefore, the analysis could not conclusively identify a different service or application on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e tcp.payload

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
