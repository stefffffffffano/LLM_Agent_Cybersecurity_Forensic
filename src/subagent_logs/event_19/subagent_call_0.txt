ip.addr eq sneezy/24
The CIDR notation can only be used on IP addresses or hostnames, not in
variable names.  So, a display filter like "ip.src/24 == ip.dst/24" is
not valid (yet).
Transaction and other IDs are often represented by unsigned 16 or 32 bit integers
and formatted as a hexadecimal string with "0x" prefix:
(dhcp.id == 0xfe089c15) || (ip.id == 0x0373)
Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract application layer data from traffic on port 6379, which is commonly associated with Redis. Initial attempts to use the `-e data` field did not yield results, and searches for Redis-specific fields in the tshark manual were unsuccessful. A general approach to display all fields for traffic on port 6379 resulted in an output that was too long. Without specific Redis fields identified, the analysis could not proceed further to extract application layer data for Redis traffic.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
