TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempts to extract application layer data using the `-e data.text` and `-e data` fields did not yield any results, indicating that the data might be encoded or stored in a different field. Redis uses a simple text-based protocol, but it might be captured differently in the PCAP file. Despite searching the tshark manual for the appropriate field or method to extract Redis protocol data, no suitable field was identified. Therefore, no application layer data could be extracted to confirm Redis presence or identify suspicious commands or patterns.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
