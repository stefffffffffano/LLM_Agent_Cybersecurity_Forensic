each packet read.
TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40

Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract application layer data using the '-e data' field did not yield any output, indicating that the field used might not be appropriate for extracting Redis-specific data. Despite searching the tshark manual for a more suitable field or method, no alternative was found. Therefore, the command executed did not produce any results, and no Redis commands or patterns could be identified from the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
