The previous command did not yield any output, which suggests that the data field might not be capturing the Redis command patterns as expected. This could be due to the way the data is being extracted or the specific format of the Redis protocol in the packets.

To address this, I will refine the command to look for specific Redis command patterns directly in the packet data. Redis commands often start with a specific keyword, so I will search for these keywords in the packet payloads.

Let's search for common Redis command keywords like "SET", "GET", "DEL" in the packet payloads on port 6379. I will use a display filter to look for these patterns in the data.

Executing the command to search for Redis command patterns in the packet payloads:

```tshark
-Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (data.text contains 'SET' || data.text contains 'GET' || data.text contains 'DEL')" -T fields -e data.text
```

TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark

https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

The error in the previous command suggests that the `data` field is not suitable for searching string patterns like "SET", "GET", or "DEL" directly. The manual search results indicate that I can use slicing to specify a range of bytes in the packet data to search for specific patterns. 

I will modify the command to use the slice operator to search for the Redis command patterns within a specific range of bytes in the packet payloads. This approach will help me filter for Redis command patterns more effectively.

Let's execute a command to search for Redis command patterns using the slice operator in the raw packet payloads on port 6379.

```tshark
-Y "tcp.port == 6379 && (frame[0:4] contains 'SET' || frame[0:4] contains 'GET' || frame[0:4] contains 'DEL')" -T fields -e data

So, for instance, the following filters are equivalent:
tcp.payload contains "GET"
tcp.payload contains 47.45.54
As noted above, a slice can also be compared in either way:
frame[60:2] gt 50.51
frame[60:2] gt "PQ"
The inverse does not occur; stringlike fields are not implicitly converted to
byte arrays.  (Some operators allow stringlike fields to be compared with
unquoted literals, which are then treated as strings; this is deprecated in
