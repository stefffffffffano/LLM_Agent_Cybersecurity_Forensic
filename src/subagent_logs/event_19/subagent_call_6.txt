TShark

to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in

share a powerful filter engine that helps remove
the noise from a packet trace and lets you see only the packets that interest
you.  If a packet meets the requirements expressed in your filter, then it
is displayed in the list of packets.  Display filters let you compare the
fields within a protocol against a specific value, compare fields against

Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the

Display filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a
capture file.  Note that capture filters are much more efficient
than display filters, and it may be more difficult for
TShark
to keep up
with a busy network if a display filter is specified for a live capture, so
