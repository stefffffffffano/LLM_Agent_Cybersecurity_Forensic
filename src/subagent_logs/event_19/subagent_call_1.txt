Final report from the forensic expert:
Despite multiple attempts to extract Redis protocol commands using various fields and methods, including `redis.command`, `data.text`, and `data`, no output was found. The final attempt to extract raw data using the `-x` option resulted in an output that was too long, and further refinement using `-e data.text` still yielded no results. This suggests that the expected Redis protocol commands or patterns are not present in the PCAP file in a recognizable format or that the fields used were not appropriate for capturing the data. Therefore, no Redis protocol commands could be confirmed from the traffic on port 6379.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
