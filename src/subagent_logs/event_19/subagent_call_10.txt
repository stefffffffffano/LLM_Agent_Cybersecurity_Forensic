DESCRIPTION
TShark
is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved

**Similarity: 0.31**
TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

each packet read.
TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark
(1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way
TShark
handles this.

the raw packet data for the field.
A character string must be decoded from a source encoding during dissection.
If there are decoding errors the resulting string will usually contain
replacement characters:
browser.comment == "string is ����"
The at operator allows testing the raw undecoded data:
@browser.comment == 73:74:72:69:6e:67:20:69:73:20:aa:aa:aa:aa
The syntactical rules for a bytes field type apply to the second example.

jsonraw
JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.
It can be used with
-j
or
-J
to specify which protocols to include.
Example of usage:
tshark -T jsonraw -r file.pcap
tshark -T jsonraw -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap
pdml
Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
packet details printed with the
-V
option.  Using the
--color
option
will add color attributes to
pdml
output.  These attributes are

Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract Redis protocol data using the field 'data.text' returned no output. This was likely due to the incorrect field name for extracting raw payload data. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct field name, no suitable field was identified. Therefore, the task of extracting Redis command patterns like 'AUTH', 'PING', 'SET', 'GET', 'DEL' could not be completed with the available information.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
