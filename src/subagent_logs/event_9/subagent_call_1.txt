TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

-T fields
option is
selected. Column types may be used prefixed with "_ws.col."
Example:
tshark -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.addr -e udp -e _ws.col.info
Fields are separated by tab characters by default.
-E
controls the
format of the printed fields.
Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print the protocol summary
(subtree label) from the packet details as a single field.

tshark -T fields -E separator=, -E quote=d

Example:
tshark -z io,stat,0.010,"SUM(frame.len)frame.len"
Reports the total number of bytes that were transmitted bidirectionally in
all the packets within a 10 millisecond interval.
MIN/MAX/AVG
- The minimum, maximum, or average field value
in each interval is calculated.  The specified field must be a named integer,
float, double or relative time field.  For relative time fields, the output is
presented in seconds with six decimal digits of precision rounded to the nearest
microsecond.
