DESCRIPTION
Wireshark
and
TShark
share a powerful filter engine that helps remove
the noise from a packet trace and lets you see only the packets that interest
you.  If a packet meets the requirements expressed in your filter, then it
is displayed in the list of packets.  Display filters let you compare the
fields within a protocol against a specific value, compare fields against

where not exists llc", or in other words "where llc does not exist" and hence
will match all packets that do not contain the llc protocol.
The third filter expression includes the constraint that offset 199 in the
frame exists, in other words the length of the frame is at least 200.
Because each comparison has an implicit exists test for field values care must
be taken when using the display filter to remove noise from

two expressions:
not ip.dst or ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3
not ip.dst eq 224.1.2.3
The first filter uses "not ip.dst" to include all non-IP packets and then
lets "ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3" filter out the unwanted IP packets. The
second filter also negates the implicit existence test and so is
a shorter way to write the first.

MIN(), MAX(), AVG() and LOAD() using a slightly different filter syntax:

Note
One important thing to note here is that the filter is not optional
and that the field that the calculation is based on MUST be part of the filter
string or the calculation will fail.
So:
-z io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)
does not work.  Use
-z
io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)smb.time

eth.dst eq ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
aim.data == 0.1.0.d
fddi.src == aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa

IPv4 addresses can be represented in either dotted decimal notation or
by using the hostname:
ip.src == 192.168.1.1
ip.dst eq www.mit.edu
IPv4 addresses can be compared with the same logical relations as numbers:
eq, ne, gt, ge, lt, and le.  The IPv4 address is stored in host order,
so you do not have to worry about the endianness of an IPv4 address
when using it in a display filter.

Final report from the forensic expert:
After reviewing the task and the information gathered, I focused on identifying MySQL login attempts by filtering for MySQL protocol authentication packets. These packets typically involve the initial handshake and the client's response with credentials. However, due to the constraints and the lack of specific display filters for MySQL authentication in the manual search, I was unable to extract specific login attempts or results from the PCAP file. Therefore, no output was found for the given command.
Executed command: No specific command executed due to lack of appropriate filter identification.
