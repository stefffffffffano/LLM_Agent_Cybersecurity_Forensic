Final report from the forensic expert:
After attempting to filter for LDAP traffic on standard ports (389 and 636) and finding no results, I searched for LDAP-related filters in the tshark manual. However, I was unable to find any specific filters that could help identify LDAP packets regardless of the port used. Therefore, I conclude that there is no LDAP-related traffic in the provided PCAP file based on the available information and filtering attempts.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 389"

Command output: No output found for the given command.
