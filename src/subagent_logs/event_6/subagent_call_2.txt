-f
option is used to specify a capture
filter.  The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library;
this syntax is different from the display filter syntax described below,
and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.
Display filters in
TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As

Lower-level protocols must be explicitly specified in the filter.
Example:
tshark -T pdml -J "tcp http"
-l
Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if
-V
was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if
-V
wasn’t
specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as
-l
is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and

A character string must be decoded from a source encoding during dissection.
If there are decoding errors the resulting string will usually contain
replacement characters:
browser.comment == "string is ����"
The at operator allows testing the raw undecoded data:
@browser.comment == 73:74:72:69:6e:67:20:69:73:20:aa:aa:aa:aa

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis revealed an HTTP GET request to a URL that includes an LDAP URL within it, specifically 'jndi:ldap://8qvsbr.sdasda1212.cn'. This suggests an attempt to access an LDAP service through a URL embedded in an HTTP request, which could be indicative of an LDAP injection or exploitation attempt. The command to extract the raw payload of the HTTP GET request did not yield any results, possibly due to incorrect field names or filters. However, the presence of the LDAP URL in the HTTP request is a significant finding in itself.
