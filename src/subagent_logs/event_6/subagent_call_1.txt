where not exists llc", or in other words "where llc does not exist" and hence
will match all packets that do not contain the llc protocol.
The third filter expression includes the constraint that offset 199 in the
frame exists, in other words the length of the frame is at least 200.
Because each comparison has an implicit exists test for field values care must
be taken when using the display filter to remove noise from

display the non-IP packets as well, you can use one of the following
two expressions:
not ip.dst or ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3
not ip.dst eq 224.1.2.3
The first filter uses "not ip.dst" to include all non-IP packets and then
lets "ip.dst ne 224.1.2.3" filter out the unwanted IP packets. The
second filter also negates the implicit existence test and so is
a shorter way to write the first.

IPv4 addresses can be represented in either dotted decimal notation or
by using the hostname:
ip.src == 192.168.1.1
ip.dst eq www.mit.edu
IPv4 addresses can be compared with the same logical relations as numbers:
eq, ne, gt, ge, lt, and le.  The IPv4 address is stored in host order,
so you do not have to worry about the endianness of an IPv4 address
when using it in a display filter.

Name Resolution (ss7pcs)
The
ss7pcs
file is used to translate SS7 point codes to names.
It is read from the personal configuration directory.
Each line in this file consists of one network indicator followed by a dash
followed by a point code in decimal and a node name separated by whitespace.
An example is:

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying LDAP or JNDI traffic within the provided PCAP file. Initial attempts to filter for LDAP traffic using the display filter '-Y "ldap"' resulted in no output, indicating no LDAP traffic was present. Subsequent attempts to filter for JNDI traffic using '-Y "jndi"' resulted in an error, as 'jndi' is not recognized as a valid protocol or field in tshark. Manual searches for JNDI-related fields did not yield any relevant results. Finally, an attempt to extract raw payload data using '-T fields -e data' also resulted in no output. Therefore, no LDAP or JNDI traffic or suspicious patterns related to these protocols were found in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
