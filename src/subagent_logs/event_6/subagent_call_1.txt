Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a suspicious HTTP request with a URI pattern indicative of an attempted remote code execution using JNDI with an LDAP server. This is a known method for exploiting vulnerabilities like Log4Shell. The HTTP response indicated a '400 Bad Request,' suggesting the server did not process the request successfully. Attempts to extract raw payload data from the TCP stream did not yield any output, indicating no further payloads were exchanged. The executed command to extract raw data in hexadecimal format from the TCP stream returned no output, confirming the absence of additional suspicious data.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.stream eq 0" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
