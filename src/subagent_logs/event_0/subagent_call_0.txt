The previous attempts to identify HTTP traffic using standard HTTP filters have returned no output. This suggests that the traffic might not be HTTP or is using non-standard ports or encapsulation methods. Given the TCP conversations summary, the traffic is between ports 9100 and 4369, which are not standard HTTP ports.

To further investigate, I will check for any raw data in the packets that might indicate HTTP-like traffic. This can be done by examining the payload of the packets for any HTTP-like headers or requests.

Let's execute a tshark command to extract the raw data from the packets and analyze it for any HTTP-like content:

```tshark
-T fields -e data.text
```
