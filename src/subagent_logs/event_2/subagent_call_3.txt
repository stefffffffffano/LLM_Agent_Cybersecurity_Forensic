Perl-compatible regular expression
The "contains" operator allows a filter to search for a sequence of
characters, expressed as a string, or bytes, expressed as a byte array.
The type of the left hand side of the "contains" operator must be comparable to
that of the right hand side after any implicit or explicit conversions.
For example, to search for a given HTTP
URL in a capture, the following filter can be used:
http contains "https://www.wireshark.org"

as opposed to the more verbose:
tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 or tcp.port == 8080
To find HTTP requests using the HEAD or GET methods:
http.request.method in {"HEAD", "GET"}
The set of values can also contain ranges:
tcp.port in {443, 4430..4434}
ip.addr in {10.0.0.5 .. 10.0.0.9, 192.168.1.1..192.168.1.9}
frame.time_delta in {10 .. 10.5}
Implicit type conversions
Fields which are sequences of bytes, including protocols, are implicitly

For example, to search for a given HTTP

The "contains" operator cannot be used on atomic fields,
such as numbers or IP addresses.
The "matches" or "~" operator allows a filter to apply to a specified
Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE2).  The regular expression must
be a double quoted string.  The left hand side of the "matches" operator

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempts to filter HTTP requests containing path traversal sequences using both the 'contains' and 'matches' operators were unsuccessful due to incorrect syntax. The manual suggested using the 'matches' operator for regular expressions, but the command still resulted in an error. The error indicates that the path traversal sequence '../' is too long to be a valid character constant, and no valid syntax was found to filter these requests successfully.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri matches '../'" -T fields -e http.request.uri

Command output: Error: The command resulted in an error due to incorrect syntax for filtering path traversal sequences. The path traversal sequence '../' is too long to be a valid character constant.
