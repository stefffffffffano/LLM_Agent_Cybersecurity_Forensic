Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed multiple HTTP GET requests attempting directory traversal attacks targeting sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and others. Additionally, a POST request was identified targeting `/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh`, which suggests a potential command injection attempt. The detailed HTTP headers and payloads were extracted to confirm these activities.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -V
