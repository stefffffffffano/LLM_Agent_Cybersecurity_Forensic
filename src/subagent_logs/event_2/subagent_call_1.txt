The HTTP response status codes have been extracted, showing a mix of 200, 403, and 404 status codes. To further analyze the server responses for signs of successful exploitation or error messages, it would be beneficial to extract the full HTTP response headers and bodies associated with these status codes. This will provide more context about the server's responses.

Let's proceed by extracting the HTTP response headers and bodies to gain more insight into the server's behavior. I will use a tshark command to display the HTTP response headers and bodies.

```tshark
-Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.response.line -e http.response.phrase -e http.file_data
```
