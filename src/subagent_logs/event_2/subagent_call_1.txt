Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP requests attempting to access sensitive files on the server, such as '/etc/passwd', '/etc/shadow', and other configuration and log files. This indicates a potential directory traversal attack, where the attacker is trying to access files outside the web server's root directory by manipulating the URL path. The HTTP response codes showed a mix of successful (200 OK) and unsuccessful (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found) requests, suggesting that some of the attack attempts were successful while others were blocked or the resources were not found. The absence of User-Agent headers and the presence of encoded characters in the request URIs further suggest the use of automated attack tools or scripts. The executed command successfully extracted the HTTP request URIs, confirming the presence of directory traversal patterns.
Executed command: -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.request.uri
