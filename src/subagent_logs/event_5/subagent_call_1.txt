Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to identify signs of SQL injection attempts, particularly those exploiting CVE-2017-8917, by examining SQL queries or patterns in the PCAP file. Initial attempts to extract payload data using the 'data.text' field yielded no results, likely due to incorrect field usage. Subsequent efforts to use the '-x' option for a hex and ASCII dump resulted in excessive output, necessitating further refinement. Attempts to filter for SQL-related keywords using 'frame contains' were invalid due to syntax issues. Despite these challenges, the analysis was unable to extract or identify SQL queries or injection patterns from the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 3306" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
