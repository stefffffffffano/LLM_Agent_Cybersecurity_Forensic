Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to confirm the presence of MySQL traffic in the PCAP file by extracting MySQL protocol details. Initially, I attempted to filter MySQL traffic using the 'mysql' display filter and extract relevant fields. However, the output was too long, indicating significant MySQL traffic. I then tried to refine the command by filtering for specific MySQL query types like 'SELECT', but encountered an error due to incorrect filter syntax. Despite attempts to find the correct syntax for filtering MySQL queries with specific keywords, I was unable to resolve the issue. Therefore, I could not extract specific MySQL protocol details, but the initial long output confirms the presence of MySQL traffic in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "mysql.query contains 'SELECT'" -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e mysql.query

Command output: Error: Command '['tshark', '-r', 'C:\Users\Stefano\OneDrive\Desktop\LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic\src\data\raw\eventID_5\CVE-2023-23752.pcap', '-Y', "mysql.query contains 'SELECT'", '-T', 'fields', '-e', 'frame.number', '-e', 'ip.src', '-e', 'ip.dst', '-e', 'mysql.query']' returned non-zero exit status 4. tshark: 'SELECT' is too long to be a valid character constant. mysql.query contains 'SELECT' ^~~~~~~~
