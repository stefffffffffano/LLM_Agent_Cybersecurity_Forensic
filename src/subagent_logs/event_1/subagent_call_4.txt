The extracted payload data from the packets on port 3000 shows a sequence of bytes: `53:51:4c:69:74:65:20:66:6f:72:6d:61:74:20:33:00:10:00:01:01`. 

To further analyze this, I will translate the hexadecimal payload to ASCII to check for any SQL commands or anomalies. 

The ASCII translation of the payload is: `SQLite format 3...`

This indicates that the payload contains the header of an SQLite database file, which starts with "SQLite format 3". This is a normal header for SQLite database files, but given the task, we need to check for any unusual SQL commands or malformed database files.

Since the payload indicates the presence of an SQLite database, I will now focus on identifying any unusual SQL commands or anomalies within this traffic. To do this, I will search for any SQL-related keywords or patterns in the payload data on port 3000.

Let's execute a tshark command to search for SQL-related keywords in the payload data on port 3000. I will look for common SQL keywords like "SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", etc., in the payload data.

```bash
-Y "tcp.port == 3000 && data contains 'SELECT' || data contains 'INSERT' || data contains 'UPDATE' || data contains 'DELETE'" -T fields -e data
```

TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

To correctly search for SQL-related keywords in the payload data on port 3000, I need to ensure the syntax for using the "contains" operator with multiple keywords is correct. Based on the tshark manual, I should use separate conditions for each keyword and combine them with logical operators.

Let's refine the command to search for each SQL keyword separately and combine them using logical OR operators. I will execute the following tshark command:

```bash
-Y "tcp.port == 3000 && (data contains 'SELECT' || data contains 'INSERT' || data contains 'UPDATE' || data contains 'DELETE')" -T fields -e data
```

}
