Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote
or an arbitrary byte represented in either octal or hexadecimal.
browser.comment == "An embedded \" double-quote"
Use of hexadecimal to look for "HEAD":

that of the right hand side after any implicit or explicit conversions.
For example, to search for a given HTTP
URL in a capture, the following filter can be used:
http contains "https://www.wireshark.org"
The "contains" operator cannot be used on atomic fields,
such as numbers or IP addresses.
The "matches" or "~" operator allows a filter to apply to a specified
Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE2).  The regular expression must
be a double quoted string.  The left hand side of the "matches" operator

Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract HTTP response codes and content lengths for requests with directory traversal patterns. However, attempts to filter HTTP requests containing '../' using the 'contains' operator resulted in errors due to invalid character constants. Subsequent attempts to use regular expressions with the '~' operator also failed due to incorrect escape sequences for the dot character. Despite multiple corrections, the command continued to produce errors, indicating a persistent issue with the escape sequence handling in the filter expression. As a result, no output was obtained for the given command.
Executed command: -Y "http.request.uri ~ \"\.\.\/\"" -T fields -e http.request.uri -e http.response.code -e http.content_length
