specifies the stream to be displayed. There are three formats:
ip-addr0:port0,ip-addr1:port1
stream-index

FILTER SYNTAX
Check whether a field or protocol exists
The simplest filter allows you to check for the existence of a protocol or
field.  If you want to see all packets which contain the IP protocol, the
filter would be "ip" (without the quotation marks). To see all packets

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the TCP traffic on port 3000 revealed that an HTTP service is running on this port. Multiple GET requests were made to 'localhost:3000' using a web browser with a specific user agent. Further analysis of HTTP response details showed a mix of HTTP status codes, including 200 (OK), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 404 (Not Found). This indicates that the service is responding to requests, but there are some errors and missing resources. The presence of HTTP traffic confirms that the service on port 3000 is likely a web application or server.
