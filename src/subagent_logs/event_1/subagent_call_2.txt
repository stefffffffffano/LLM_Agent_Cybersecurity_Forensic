Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract HTTP requests with directory traversal patterns from traffic on port 3000. The initial approach was to use a filter with the 'contains' operator to detect '../' patterns in the HTTP request URI. However, this resulted in an error due to the incorrect use of the string '../' in the filter. Attempts to find guidance on using special characters and regular expressions in display filters through the manual search were unsuccessful. As a result, I was unable to find a valid command to extract the desired information from the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "http.request and tcp.port == 3000 and http.request.uri contains '../'" -T fields -e ip.src -e http.request.uri

Error in the command
