Lower-level protocols must be explicitly specified in the filter.
Example:
tshark -T pdml -J "tcp http"
-l
Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if
-V
was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if
-V
wasn’t
specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as
-l
is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting raw payload data from the PCAP file to identify unusual SQL commands or anomalies that could indicate an attempt to exploit SQLite vulnerabilities. Initial attempts to extract raw data using general filters resulted in outputs that were too long. Further refinement using specific TCP port filters and limiting the number of packets did not yield any output. Attempts to filter specific TCP streams were inconclusive due to lack of stream index identification. Therefore, no unusual SQL commands or anomalies were found in the traffic between the internal IPs on port 3000.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 3000" -x -c 10

Command output: No output found for the given command.
