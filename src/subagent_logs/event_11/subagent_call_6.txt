TShark
is part of the
Wireshark

AUTHORS
TShark
uses the same packet dissection code that
Wireshark
does,
as well as using many other modules from
Wireshark
; see the list of
authors in the
Wireshark
man page for a list of authors of that code.

TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of

is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way

JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.
It can be used with

Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the

Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract raw payload data from TCP packets on port 5432 to analyze PostgreSQL traffic. The initial command used to extract the raw payload data did not yield any output. This could be due to incorrect filtering or the absence of data in the specified field. Despite attempts to verify the correctness of the display filter and field extraction syntax by consulting the tshark manual, no further insights were gained. Therefore, the final result is that no output was found for the given command, indicating either no data was present or the command was not correctly structured for the dataset.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 5432" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
