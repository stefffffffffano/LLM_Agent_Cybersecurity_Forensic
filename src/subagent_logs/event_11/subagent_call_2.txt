Extract most important fields from diameter CC messages:
tshark -r file.cap.gz -q -z diameter,avp,272,CC-Request-Type,CC-Request-Number,Session-Id,Subscription-Id-Data,Rating-Group,Result-Code
Following fields will be printed out for each diameter message:
"frame"        Frame number.
"time"         Unix time of the frame arrival.
"src"          Source address.
"srcport"      Source port.

For a simple example to add the "nfs.fh.hash" field to the Info column
for all packets containing the "nfs.fh.hash" field, use
-z proto,colinfo,nfs.fh.hash,nfs.fh.hash
To put "nfs.fh.hash" in the Info column but only for packets coming from
host 1.2.3.4 use:
-z "proto,colinfo,nfs.fh.hash && ip.src==1.2.3.4,nfs.fh.hash"
This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
