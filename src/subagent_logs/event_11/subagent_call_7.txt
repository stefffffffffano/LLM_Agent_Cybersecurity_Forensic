JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.
It can be used with

Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
packet details printed with the

Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis aimed to extract raw payload data from TCP packets on port 6379 to identify any unusual or suspicious Redis commands. Initial attempts to extract raw payload data using the command '-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data' resulted in no output. Further attempts using '-T jsonraw -j "tcp"' produced an output that was too long, indicating the presence of data but requiring further refinement. Attempts to extract ASCII data using '-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text' also resulted in no output. Despite consulting the tshark manual, no successful extraction of ASCII data was achieved. The final command executed was '-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text', which yielded no output.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data.text

Command output: No output found for the given command.
