The layer operator
A field can be restricted to a certain layer in the protocol stack using the
layer operator (#), followed by a decimal number:
ip.addr#2 == 192.168.30.40
matches only the inner (second) layer in the packet.
Layers use simple stacking semantics and protocol layers are counted sequentially starting from 1.

If the timezone is omitted then date and time values are interpreted as local time.
The slice operator
You can take a slice of a field if the field base type is a text string or a
byte array (the base type of most network address fields is bytes).
For example, you can filter on the vendor portion of an ethernet address
(the first three bytes) like this:
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
Another example is:
http.content_type[0:4] == "text"
You can use the slice operator on a protocol name, too.

The "frame" protocol can be useful, encompassing all the data captured
by
Wireshark
or
TShark
.
token[0:5] ne 0.0.0.1.1
llc[0] eq aa
frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
The following syntax governs slices:
[i:j]    i = start_offset, j = length
[i-j]    i = start_offset, j = end_offset, inclusive.
[i]      i = start_offset, length = 1
[:j]     start_offset = 0, length = j
[i:]     start_offset = i, end_offset = end_of_field
Slice indexes are zero-based.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract application layer data for traffic on port 6379 using the field 'data' did not yield any output. This suggests that the field name might be incorrect or that there is no application layer data available in the PCAP file for this port. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct field name, no relevant information was found to adjust the command. Therefore, the analysis could not confirm the presence of Redis or any other application on port 6379 based on the available data.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -T fields -e data

Command output: No output found for the given command.
