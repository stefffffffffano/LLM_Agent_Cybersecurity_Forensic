TShark

TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark

is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way

Final report from the forensic expert:
The attempt to extract TCP payloads for port 5432 using the `-z follow,tcp,ascii` option resulted in an error due to incorrect usage of the `-z follow` option. The error was likely caused by the absence of a specific TCP stream index. Despite searching the tshark manual for the correct usage of the `-z follow` option, the issue could not be resolved. Therefore, no output was obtained for the given command.
