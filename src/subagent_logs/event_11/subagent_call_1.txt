Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to extract Redis protocol messages using the fields 'redis.command' and 'redis.response' resulted in an error, indicating that these fields are not valid in the current version of tshark. Despite multiple attempts to search the tshark manual for the correct field names for Redis protocol messages, no valid field names were found. Therefore, the task of extracting Redis protocol messages focusing on commands and responses could not be completed due to the unavailability of the required fields in tshark.
Executed command: -Y "redis" -T fields -e redis.command -e redis.response

Error in the command
