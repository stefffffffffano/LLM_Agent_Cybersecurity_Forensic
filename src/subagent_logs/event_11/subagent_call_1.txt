Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on identifying unusual or potentially malicious activities in the PCAP file, specifically targeting Redis traffic on port 6379. Initial attempts to extract application layer data using the `-T fields -e data` option resulted in no output, indicating that the field might not be appropriate for Redis protocol analysis. Subsequent attempts to search the tshark manual for Redis-specific field names did not yield relevant results. Attempts to display packet details for Redis traffic using the `-Y "tcp.port == 6379" -V` command resulted in output that was too long to analyze effectively. Due to these constraints, no specific unusual or malicious activities were identified in the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 6379" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
