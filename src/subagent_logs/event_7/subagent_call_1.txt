TShark
, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in
TShark
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As
TShark
progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
Wireshark
; a display filter is specified with the
-Y
option.

Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract MySQL protocol details from traffic on port 3306 to confirm the service. Initially, a command was executed to filter for MySQL traffic and display protocol details, but the output was too long. Attempts were made to refine the command using the '-T fields' option to select specific MySQL fields. However, the search for specific MySQL fields in the tshark manual did not yield useful results. Therefore, the final command could not be refined further to extract specific MySQL protocol details.
Executed command: -Y "mysql" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
