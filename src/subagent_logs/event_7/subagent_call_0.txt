TShark
is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by
Wireshark
.  The input file
doesnâ€™t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark

https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed
description of the way
Wireshark
handles this, which is the same way

fields
The values of fields specified with the
-e
option, in a
form specified by the
-E
option.  For example,
tshark -T fields -E separator=, -E quote=d
would generate comma-separated values (CSV) output suitable for importing
into your favorite spreadsheet program.

Example:
tshark -z io,stat,0.010,"SUM(frame.len)frame.len"
Reports the total number of bytes that were transmitted bidirectionally in
all the packets within a 10 millisecond interval.
MIN/MAX/AVG
- The minimum, maximum, or average field value
in each interval is calculated.  The specified field must be a named integer,
float, double or relative time field.  For relative time fields, the output is
presented in seconds with six decimal digits of precision rounded to the nearest
microsecond.
