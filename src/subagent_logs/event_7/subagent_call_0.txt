Final report from the forensic expert:
The task was to extract application layer protocol details from traffic on port 3306, which is typically used by MySQL. Initially, I attempted to display the protocol details for packets on this port, but the output was too long. I then aimed to refine the command by focusing on specific fields related to the MySQL protocol. However, I encountered difficulties in identifying the appropriate field names for the MySQL protocol using the tshark manual. Due to these challenges, I was unable to extract specific MySQL protocol details from the PCAP file.
Executed command: -Y "tcp.port == 3306" -V

Command output: Output too long, please refine your command using additional tshark options like -Y filters.
