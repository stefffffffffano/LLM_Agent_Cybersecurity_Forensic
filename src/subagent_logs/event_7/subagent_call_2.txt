as opposed to the more verbose:
tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 or tcp.port == 8080
To find HTTP requests using the HEAD or GET methods:
http.request.method in {"HEAD", "GET"}
The set of values can also contain ranges:
tcp.port in {443, 4430..4434}
ip.addr in {10.0.0.5 .. 10.0.0.9, 192.168.1.1..192.168.1.9}

and formatted as a hexadecimal string with "0x" prefix:
(dhcp.id == 0xfe089c15) || (ip.id == 0x0373)
Strings are enclosed in double quotes:
http.request.method == "POST"
Inside double quotes, you may use a backslash to embed a double quote
or an arbitrary byte represented in either octal or hexadecimal.
browser.comment == "An embedded \" double-quote"
Use of hexadecimal to look for "HEAD":
http.request.method == "\x48EAD"
Use of octal to look for "HEAD":
http.request.method == "\110EAD"

**Similarity: 0.44**
A field may be checked for matches against a set of values simply with the
membership operator. For instance, you may find traffic on common HTTP/HTTPS
ports with the following filter:
tcp.port in {80,443,8080}
as opposed to the more verbose:
tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 or tcp.port == 8080
