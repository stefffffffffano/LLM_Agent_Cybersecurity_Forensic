Final report from the forensic expert:
The initial attempt to search for the terms 'enc.clear.load', 'cmd.ping', and 'cmd._prep_auth_info' using the 'frame contains' filter failed because these terms are too long to be valid character constants. Despite searching the tshark manual for alternative methods to search for these terms, no suitable solution was found. Therefore, no output was obtained for the given task.
Executed command: -Y "frame contains 'enc.clear.load' || frame contains 'cmd.ping' || frame contains 'cmd._prep_auth_info'"

Error in the command
