Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the HTTP traffic in the provided PCAP file revealed attempts to access sensitive files and directories on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. These requests are indicative of directory traversal attacks, where the attacker tries to access files outside the web server's root directory. The HTTP requests and responses did not reveal any specific application or service names in the headers or payloads. Attempts to extract additional HTTP headers for application or service names were unsuccessful due to invalid field names.
