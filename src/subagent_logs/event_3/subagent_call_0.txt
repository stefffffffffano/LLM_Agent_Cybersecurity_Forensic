Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis of the PCAP file revealed a series of HTTP GET requests targeting sensitive files and directories, indicative of a directory traversal attack. The requests attempted to access files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/var/log/syslog`. However, all requests resulted in a "400 Bad Request" response, indicating that the server did not process them successfully. This suggests that the server may have security measures in place to block such attempts. No additional HTTP headers like `Referer` or `Accept` were present in the requests.
Executed command: -Y "http.response" -T fields -e http.response.code -e http.response.phrase
