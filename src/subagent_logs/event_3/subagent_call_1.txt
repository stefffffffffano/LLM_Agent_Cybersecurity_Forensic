Final report from the forensic expert:
The analysis focused on extracting HTTP requests and their headers to identify any specific application or service names. Initially, the HTTP host and user agent fields were extracted, revealing only 'localhost' for the host and no user agent information. This suggested that the HTTP requests were made to a local server, with no specific application or service names in the user agent field. Attempts to extract additional headers like 'http.server' and 'http.x_powered_by' were unsuccessful due to invalid field names. Despite efforts to find correct field names in the manuals, no relevant information was found. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the PCAP file does not contain identifiable application or service names in the HTTP headers.
