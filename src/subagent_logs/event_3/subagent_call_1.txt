The HTTP responses extracted from the PCAP file all indicate "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request". This suggests that the requests sent to the server were malformed or not understood by the server. To further investigate potential remote code execution attempts, I should examine the HTTP requests to see if there are any unusual patterns or payloads that might have triggered these bad requests.

I will now extract the HTTP requests from the PCAP file to analyze them for any signs of remote code execution attempts.

Let's execute the following tshark command to extract HTTP requests:

```tshark
-Y "http.request"
```
