    description="""
    A specialized sub-agent for executing tshark commands on PCAP files.
    Input requirements:
    - A precise technical goal (e.g., extract fields, decode payloads, filter sessions,extract TCP traffic on port x).
    This has to be provided in the form:
    Description of the analysis objective: <description>

    Behavior:
    - The Tshark Expert attempts to execute a tshark command to accomplish the task assigned.
    - If the command is malformed or the output is not useful, it tries to autonomously correct or adjust the query.
    - If the analysis fails to complete after adjustments, it returns an error message.
    Guidelines for using the tshark_expert:
    - Provide clear, high-level objectives in your request (e.g., "Extract HTTP requests and their headers", "Find all TCP retransmissions").
    - If the task is related to a specific CVE, you must translate the CVE impact into a network behavior or observable pattern (e.g., "Look for signs of remote code execution attempts").
    - Avoid asking the tshark_expert to identify CVEs, exploits, vulnerabilities, or application-specific logic, he doesnâ€™t know about those details.
    - The sub-agent expects technical goals (such as "extract fields", "filter packets matching condition X") expressed in network analysis terms.
    Important:
    - This agent can optimize tshark commands but cannot independently infer complex forensic conclusions (e.g., exploitation detection must be guided by specific data extraction instructions).
    - DO NOT ASK FOR SIGN OF EXPLOITATION OF SPECIFIC SERVICES OR CVES, THE SUBAGENT IS ONLY AN EXPERT IN TSHARK COMMANDS.
